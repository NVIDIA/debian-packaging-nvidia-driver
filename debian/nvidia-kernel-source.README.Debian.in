nvidia-graphics-drivers for Debian
----------------------------------


INTRODUCTION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to Debian NVIDIA packages. This document contains notes on  the 
kernel module interface for the NVIDIA driver offering.


KERNEL MODULE INSTRUCTIONS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are TWO ways to build the nvidia-kernel package. Which one depends on
your situation with your kernel.

 METHOD #1: You are running a Debian suppiled kernel or built a 
    kernel-headers package along with your own self-built kernel. 

 METHOD #2: You are running your own self-built kernel built from kernel
    source. 

Which method you choose really depends on what kernel headers you wish to
use, those from a kernel-headers package or those from kernel
source (from which you built your own kernel). 

As mentioned above, if you are running a Debian supplied kernel you will
probably want to choose METHOD #1. If you compile your own kernels, METHOD #2.



PRELIMINARY: 
- Decide where you want to build your module. By default it 
will build under /usr/src like other kernel modules but you may choose 
to build it under your home directory as some people prefer and writing to 
/usr violates the FHS. 


SUPPORT FOR 2.6 KERNELS:
------------------------
As of 1.0.5336-1, NVIDIA includes support for a 2.6 kernel. No extra steps are
required.


HOTPLUG SUPPORT:
------------------------
As of version 1.0.5336-8 there is hotplug module loading support provided 
in patches that are applied by default but by default, hotplug is set to 
ignore PCI/AGP cards for display. To change this set IGNORE_PCI_CLASS_DISPLAY 
to false in /etc/default/hotplug or run 
dpkg-reconfigure -plow hotplug



METHOD #1 Using a kernel-headers package
***********************************************************************

As root (or using fakeroot)
1. cd /usr/src 
   tar xzvf nvidia-kernel-source.tar.gz -C <YOUR BUILD LOCATION>         
   (It will install in <YOU BUILD LOCATION>/modules) 
   - or -
   tar xzvf nvidia-kernel-source.tar.gz  (if building in /usr/src) 
   
   The standard build location is /usr/src
   
2. Find out your kernel version:
	             
   uname -r   For example: 2.4.21-4-k7
				          
3. Download and install package: kernel-headers-2.4.21-4-k7
   It will install in /usr/src/
   
   Make sure your kernel image and headers have matching release numbers to
   avoid possible problems in packages built from different sources. 
   
4. Set some environment variables (if bash is your shell):
	           
    export KSRC=/usr/src/kernel-headers-2.4.21-4-k7
    export KVERS=2.4.21-4-k7
			 		            
5. Then build nvidia-kernel package:
	      	           
   cd <YOUR BUILD LOCATION>/modules/nvidia-kernel
   debian/rules binary_modules
   
(You can also combine step 4 and 5 into one line:
KSRC=/usr/src/kernel-headers-2.4.21-4-k7 KVERS=2.4.21-4-k7 debian/rules binary_modules)
				 	      		    	   
6. Install nvidia-kernel-common:
   
   If not installed already
   apt-get install nvidia-kernel-common
   
7. Install the nvidia-kernel package:
	    		     
   dpkg -i ../nvidia-kernel-2.4.21-4-k7_#VERSION#-1+_.Custom_i386.deb
   ( or similar filename )

Now see GENERAL NOTES below method #2

METHOD #2: Using your own kernel source headers
***********************************************************************

To build the nvidia-kernel deb you need to first make sure you have
kernel-package installed, then do the following:

As root
1. cd /usr/src
   tar xzvf nvidia-kernel-source.tar.gz -C <YOUR BUILD LOCATION>         
   (It will install in <YOU BUILD LOCATION>/modules) 
   - or -
   tar xzvf nvidia-kernel-source.tar.gz  (if building in /usr/src) 

2. If you are NOT using the default modules location /usr/src/modules
   then you must set an environment variable that points to your modules
   location.
     
     export MODULE_LOC=<YOUR BUILD LOCATION>/modules
     
   This is needed by make-kpkg which is used later. If 
   <YOUR BUILD LOCATION> is /usr/src there is no need to set this.
     
3. Build the modules under MODULE_LOC i.e. <YOU BUILD LOCATION>/modules 

     cd linux (or your kernel source directory)
     make-kpkg modules_image

4. Install nvidia-kernel-common:

   apt-get install nvidia-kernel-common

5. Install the nvidia-kernel package:
     
     cd <YOUR BUILD LOCATION>    (e.g. /usr/src)
     dpkg -i nvidia-kernel-KVER*.deb

Notes for method #2: 

- It is advised not to clean the kernel source tree between 
"make-kpkg kernel_image" and "make-kpkg modules_image". 

- The Riva framebuffer is known to conflict with the nvidia X driver. If you
are using X it would be wise not to compile it in. The vesa framebuffer is
known to work in some cases, and not in others. (people have recently been
having problems with the vesa driver as well) 

GENERAL NOTES:

Also you must add any users who wish to use OpenGL applications to the group
video. You can do this with:

	adduser username video

Also note for AGP issues and further information please see the NVIDIA
README file (README.gz) in the nvidia-glx package 

An old nvidia.o might be already loaded (run 'lsmod' to check) so 
do 'rmmod nvidia.o' to remove the module from memory.
