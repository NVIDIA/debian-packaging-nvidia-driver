# The libnvidia-rtcore.so.* SONAME changes with every upstream

# These private libraries are only used (and usable) as plugins
# loaded by other NVIDIA libraries with the same upstream version
# (and a stable SONAME).
# Therefore we do not include the SONAME in this package name to
# avoid going through NEW for every new upstream release.
