  * New upstream beta 346.16 (2014-11-13).
    - Updated nvidia-installer to install a file in the system's xorg.conf.d
      directory, when a sufficiently new X server is detected, to cause the X
      server to load the "nvidia" X driver automatically if it is started after
      the NVIDIA kernel module is loaded.
      This feature is supported in X.Org xserver 1.16 and higher when running on
      Linux 3.9 or higher with CONFIG_DRM enabled.

Consider renaming nvidia-opencl-icd to nvidia-icd (or similar) and make
nvidia-opencl-icd a dummy package that at most Suggests: nvidia-icd.
cf. #769072

Goals for jessie:
=================

  * automatic configuration of Xorg
    - fix Xorg autodetection (which may be an insufficiency in the nvidia
      driver that does not expose its supported PCI IDs properly), see
      #586502
