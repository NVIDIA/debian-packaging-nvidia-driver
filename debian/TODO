Goals for wheezy:
=================

  * automatic configuration of Xorg
    - fix Xorg autodetection (which may be an insufficiency in the nvidia
      driver that does not expose its supported PCI IDs properly), see
      #586502
    - OR use debconf to create a minimal xorg.conf (unless one already
      exists), see #612093

  * multiarch support - is this going to be in wheezy?
    - implemention would go best together with the previous point because it
      involves moving around a lot of files and alternatives


When to remove old relationships and maintainer script code:
============================================================

All package relationships introduced for squeeze as well as all
"transitional" maintainer script code (tagged <target: squeeze>) should
remain in the package until wheezy is released.  That way backports to
squeeze can be done easily without requiring the package being upgraded
from is recent enough.  The removed transitional packages do not matter
as the old packages are now having Conflicts/Replaces in new packages 
that are going to be installed.
