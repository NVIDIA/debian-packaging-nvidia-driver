Description: fix module build failure for Linux 5.7
 I was trying to test nvidia drivers with the new kernel in experimental
 5.7.0-rc5-686-pae. In the build log, I noticed it failed due to missing
 functions set_memory_array_wb and friends. However, the code seemed to
 be prepared for that possibility, so the problem must be the conftest.
 .
 I checked the output from the compilation checks and found some are
 failing for the wrong reason, which causes some functions to be wrongly
 detected as present (!) and some wrongly detected as missing. This would
 probably apply to the other branches of nvidia drivers as well. I
 prepared a patch for this, some comments:
 .
 - asm/page.h and asm/pgtable.h are needed for the pgprop_t type. Some
   arches have here, some have it there. Otherwise the compilation
   wrongly fails and detects the functions as present
 .
 I checked that these files were present in the linux kernel since
 2.6.39, but haven't tested compilation with such old kernels. It should,
 however, work.
