This package builds the NVIDIA Xorg binary kernel module needed by
nvidia-glx, using DKMS.

Provided that you have the kernel header packages installed, the kernel
module will be built for your running kernel and automatically rebuilt for
any new kernel headers that are installed.

If the kernel module is not built automatically, please ensure that the
correct kernel headers are installed.
