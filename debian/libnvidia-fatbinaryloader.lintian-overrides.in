# The libnvidia-fatbinaryloader.so.* SONAME changes with every upstream release.
# But it is a (huge) plugin that is only used from other NVIDIA libraries
# with the same upstream version (and a constant SONAME), so don't include
# the SONAME in the package name to avoid going through NEW with every new
# upstream release.
