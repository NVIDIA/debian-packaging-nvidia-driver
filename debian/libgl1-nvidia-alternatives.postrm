# Rationale:
#
# Remove our diversions at the remove stage, since even if we have
# configuration files left, we want to put back everything we moved.  Do not
# try to do this again on purge since remove will have already been called.
#
# Leave all of our diversions alone during upgrades or aborted upgrades, since
# we're staying installed in all cases and the diversions are still correct.
#
# It's not clear what to do on disappear, but for now leave everything alone
# and assume that our overwriting package will have logic to take over the
# diversions and doesn't want us messing with them.
