Description: NVIDIA binary Xorg driver
 These binary drivers provide optimized hardware acceleration of
 OpenGL applications via a direct-rendering X Server.
 AGP, PCIe, SLI, TV-out and flat panel displays are also supported.
 .
 Please see the nvidia-kernel-source or nvidia-kernel-dkms packages for
 building the kernel module required by this package.  This will provide
 nvidia-kernel-${nvidia:Version}.
 .
 This version only supports GeForce 6xxx and higher of the Geforce GPUs
 plus complimentary Quadros and nforce.  Look at the legacy packages
 for older cards.
 .
 See /usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx/README.txt.gz for a complete list
 of supported GPUs and PCIIDs.
