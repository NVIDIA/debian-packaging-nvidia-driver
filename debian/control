 Please see the nvidia-kernel-dkms or
 nvidia-kernel-source packages
 for building the kernel module required by this package.
 This will provide nvidia-kernel-${nvidia:Version}.
 .
 This version only supports GeForce 6xxx and higher of the Geforce GPUs
 plus complimentary Quadros and nforce.  Look at the legacy packages
 for older cards.
