nvidia-graphics-drivers#LEGACY# for Debian
----------------------------------


INTRODUCTION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Debian NVIDIA packages. This document has notes on the
X Server and GL libraries of the NVIDIA driver offering.

For any news on this package check
http://bugs.debian.org/nvidia-glx#LEGACY#


NOTES ABOUT GLX DRIVER AND OPENGL:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the nvidia X driver requires some user modification.

The current X Server 1.7 can autodetect many things, so you probably don't
have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf at all after a fresh installation of Debian sarge
or a newer release.

The NVIDIA driver is not autodetected by Xorg, so you will have to create a
minimal /etc/X11/xorg.conf (or modify an existing one):

	Section "Device"
	    Identifier     "My GPU"
	    Driver         "nvidia"
	EndSection

That is sufficient to load the NVIDIA driver while all other configuration
is automatically done by the X Server.  If you have multiple displays, you
may want to enable TwinView, too, by adding this section:

	Section "Screen"
	    Identifier     "My Screens"
	    Option         "TwinView" "1"
	EndSection

There are many more settings that can be tuned in xorg.conf.  For file
format description and general options please see the xorg.conf(5) manpage.
See /usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx#LEGACY#/README.txt.gz
for descriptions of all supported NVIDIA driver specific options.


NOTES ABOUT XvMC:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable accelerated XVideo Motion Compensation (XvMC) which is supported
on GeForce 6 series and GeForce 7 series GPUs, you need to modify
/etc/X11/XvMCConfig to contain a reference to the NVIDIA library
    libXvMCNVIDIA_dynamic.so.1
instead.  For more information about XvMC support see Appendix G in 
/usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx#LEGACY#/README.txt.gz
