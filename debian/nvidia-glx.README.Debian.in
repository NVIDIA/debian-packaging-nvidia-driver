nvidia-graphics-drivers#LEGACY# for Debian
----------------------------------


INTRODUCTION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Debian NVIDIA packages. This document has notes on the
X Server and GL libraries of the NVIDIA driver offering.

For any news on this package check
http://bugs.debian.org/nvidia-glx#LEGACY#


NOTES ABOUT GLX DRIVER AND OPENGL:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the nvidia X driver requires some user modification.

The current X Server 1.7 can autodetect many things, so you probably don't
have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf at all after a fresh installation of Debian squeeze
or a newer release.

The NVIDIA driver is not autodetected by Xorg, so you will have to create a
minimal /etc/X11/xorg.conf (or modify an existing one):

	Section "Device"
	    Identifier     "My GPU"
	    Driver         "nvidia"
	EndSection

That is sufficient to load the NVIDIA driver while all other configuration
is automatically done by the X Server.  If you have multiple displays, you
may want to enable TwinView, too, by adding this section:

	Section "Screen"
	    Identifier     "My Screens"
	    Option         "TwinView" "1"
	EndSection

There are many more settings that can be tuned in xorg.conf.  For file
format description and general options please see the xorg.conf(5) manpage.
See /usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx#LEGACY#/README.txt.gz
for descriptions of all supported NVIDIA driver specific options.


NOTES ABOUT XEN:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The non-free NVIDIA graphics driver does not work in a Xen kernel (e.g.
linux-image-*-xen-*) running under the Xen hypervisor (xen-hypervisor-*).
It does work however if this kernel is running standalone.
Xen is currently not supported by NVIDIA.  For more information, please
see http://bugs.debian.org/570365

If you manage to get the NVIDIA driver to function properly when running
under the Xen hypervisor (e.g. by using a custom kernel configuration or
patching the module source), we would like to hear about it.


NOTES ABOUT XvMC:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable accelerated XVideo Motion Compensation (XvMC) which is supported
on GeForce 6 series and GeForce 7 series GPUs, you need to modify
/etc/X11/XvMCConfig to contain a reference to the NVIDIA library
    libXvMCNVIDIA_dynamic.so.1
instead.  For more information about XvMC support see Appendix G in
/usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx#LEGACY#/README.txt.gz


NOTES ABOUT WARNINGS emitted during installation/upgrade:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You might see these warnings while upgrading the nvidia driver package from a
release before squeeze:

    WARNING: Renaming conflicting file '<filename>' to '<filename>.dpkg-old'.

    WARNING: The file '<filename>' found on your system may interfere with accelerated OpenGL.

This usually means some file was found on your system that is not under the
control of the package manager, i.e. not owned by any package currently
installed.  The file may be remaining from an ancient buggy package
(pre-dating the lenny release) that has been upgraded/removed in the meantime
or from having used NVIDIA's installer in the past.

These files most likely can be safely moved away from the library directories
so that they may not cause harm, e.g. being preferred over the current driver
etc.  Reinstallation of the libgl1-nvidia-alternatives package is recommended
after (re-)moving these files.  This will correct missing/incorrect symbolic
links.
