nvidia-graphics-drivers#LEGACY# for Debian
----------------------------------


INTRODUCTION:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Debian NVIDIA packages. This document has notes on the
X Server and GL libraries of the NVIDIA driver offering.

For any news on this package check
http://bugs.debian.org/nvidia-glx#LEGACY#


NOTES ABOUT GLX DRIVER AND OPENGL:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the nvidia X driver requires some user modification.

The current X Server 1.7 can autodetect many things, so you probably don't
have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf at all after a fresh installation of Debian squeeze
or a newer release.

The NVIDIA driver is not autodetected by Xorg, so you will have to create a
minimal /etc/X11/xorg.conf (or modify an existing one):

	Section "Device"
	    Identifier     "My GPU"
	    Driver         "nvidia"
	EndSection

That is sufficient to load the NVIDIA driver while all other configuration
is automatically done by the X Server.  If you have multiple displays, you
may want to enable TwinView, too, by adding this section:

	Section "Screen"
	    Identifier     "My Screens"
	    Option         "TwinView" "1"
	EndSection

There are many more settings that can be tuned in xorg.conf.  For file
format description and general options please see the xorg.conf(5) manpage.
See /usr/share/doc/nvidia-glx#LEGACY#/README.txt.gz
for descriptions of all supported NVIDIA driver specific options.


NOTES ABOUT 'EQ overflowing. The server is probably stuck in an infinite loop.'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you see this error in /var/log/Xorg.0.log, please ensure that the versions
of linux-image-* and the corresponding linux-headers-* are identical up to
the last digit.  Rebuild the module for this exactly matching kernel+header
pair and reboot.  See http://bugs.debian.org/642497 for details.


NOTES ABOUT XEN:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The non-free NVIDIA graphics driver does not work in a Xen kernel (e.g.
linux-image-*-xen-*) running under the Xen hypervisor (xen-hypervisor-*).
It does work however if this kernel is running standalone.
Xen is currently not supported by NVIDIA.  For more information, please
see http://bugs.debian.org/570365

If you manage to get the NVIDIA driver to function properly when running
under the Xen hypervisor (e.g. by using a custom kernel configuration or
patching the module source), we would like to hear about it.


NOTES ABOUT WARNINGS emitted during installation/upgrade:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You might see these warnings while upgrading the nvidia driver package from a
release before squeeze:

    WARNING: Renaming conflicting file '<filename>' to '<filename>.dpkg-old'.

    WARNING: The file '<filename>' found on your system may interfere with accelerated OpenGL.

This usually means some file was found on your system that is not under the
control of the package manager, i.e. not owned by any package currently
installed.  The file may be remaining from an ancient buggy package
(pre-dating the lenny release) that has been upgraded/removed in the meantime
or from having used NVIDIA's installer in the past.

These files most likely can be safely moved away from the library directories
so that they may not cause harm, e.g. being preferred over the current driver
etc.  Reinstallation of the libgl1-nvidia-alternatives package is recommended
after (re-)moving these files.  This will correct missing/incorrect symbolic
links.


SWITCHING FROM NVIDIA WAY TO DEBIAN WAY:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you had previously installed the NVIDIA driver directly (by executing the
NVIDIA-Linux-*.run file) and want to switch to the Debian packages (which is
recommended), please follow these upgrade instructions:

http://forums.debian.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=53144#p306438

In short:
- remove all Debian *nvidia* packages
- reinstall the NVIDIA driver by executing NVIDIA-Linux-*.run again
  (otherwise removal will fail), ignore errors
- remove the driver installed from the *.run file: nvidia-installer --uninstall
- remove all nvidia.ko still found under /lib/modules
- reinstall the Debian nvidia-glx packages
