# For use with the Debian nvidia-glx package
#
# The USE_TLS variable is to force TLS (Thread
# Local Storage) versioning.
# This is normally not needed since TLS is detected
# by the /etc/init.d/nvidia-glx script automatically.
# For more information about TLS see
# http://people.redhat.com/drepper/tls.pdf


# Uncomment to force the use of NVIDIA TLS libs
#USE_TLS=1

# Uncomment to force the use of NVIDIA non-TLS libs
#USE_TLS=0
