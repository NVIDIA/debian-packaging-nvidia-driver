nvidia-graphics-drivers (396.45-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream short lived branch release 396.45 (2018-07-19).
    - Improved recovery of Vulkan direct-to-display applications after an
      application hang or crash.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause multi-threaded EGL applications to crash
      when exiting.
    - Added support for the following GPU: TITAN V JHH Special Edition.
  * New upstream short lived branch release 396.24 (2018-05-02).
    - Fixed a regression that caused the current MetaMode's ViewPortIn and
      ViewPortOut settings to be preserved across RandR modesets. The driver now
      clears ViewPortIn and ViewPortOut when the mode is set through RandR,
      restoring the behavior that existed prior to the regression.
    - Improved error reporting in the Vulkan driver if
      libnvidia-glvkspirv.so, the new Vulkan SPIR-V compiler added in
      396.18, cannot be found at run time.
    - Fixed performance regressions and corruption issues in the new Vulkan
      SPIR-V compiler.
    - Added support for 32-bit PCI domains throughout the NVIDIA driver stack.
      This support is required for running Linux VMs with recent versions of
      the pci_hyperv driver on top of Hyper-V.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (396.18-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream beta 396.18 (2018-04-10).
    - Added support for a new Vulkan SPIR-V compiler which reduces shader
      compilation time and shader system memory consumption.
      A new environment variable can be used to enable (1) (default) or
      disable (0) the new compiler if errors in existing applications
      are found:
          __GL_NextGenCompiler=<int>
      The following application profile setting with the same definition
      is also available:
          { "pattern" : [], "profile" : [ "NextGenCompiler", <int> ] }
      The old compiler is deprecated and will be removed in a future
      release.
    - Improved performance of the following Vulkan APIs:
        vkAllocateMemory(), vkBindBufferMemory(), vkBindImageMemory().
    - Fixed a bug that caused the NV_CTRL_STEREO_SWAP_MODE setting for
      quad-buffered stereo visuals to not be preserved across modesets
      or VT switches.
    - Added a new global X configuration option "AllowExternalGpus", which
      defaults to disabled, but can be enabled to allow eGPUs and other
      surprise-removable GPUs to be configured with X screens.

  * New upstream long lived branch release 390.48 (2018-03-28).
    * Fixed CVE-2018-6249, CVE-2018-6253.  (Closes: #894338)
      https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4649
    - Added support for the following GPUs: Quadro GV100,
      Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB, Tesla V100-PCIE-32GB, Tesla V100-DGXS-32GB.
    - Updated the driver to prevent G-SYNC from being enabled when a
      Quadro Sync board is installed. G-SYNC and Quadro Sync were always
      mutually incompatible features, and this change makes it easier to
      use G-SYNC capable monitors on Quadro Sync configurations, as it is
      now no longer necessary to manually disable G-SYNC.

    * Fixed CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715 (spectre), CVE-2017-5754 (meltdown).
      https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4611
      (Closes: #886852)
    - Added new application profile settings, "EGLVisibleDGPUDevices" and
      "EGLVisibleTegraDevices", to control which discrete and Tegra GPU
      devices, respectively, may be enumerated by EGL. See the "Application
      Profiles" appendix of the driver README for more details.
    - Corrected the SONAME of the copy of the libnvidia-egl-wayland library
      included in the .run installer package to libnvidia-egl-wayland.so.1.
      The SONAME had previously been versioned incorrectly with the full
      version number of the library.
    - Updated nvidia.ko to veto the ACPI_VIDEO_NOTIFY_PROBE event on
      kernels that allow the handler for this event to be overridden,
      to improve interaction between the NVIDIA driver and acpi_video
      on display hotplug events.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented Xinerama Info from being handled properly
      in SLI or Base Mosaic layouts with more than 24 displays.
    - Updated the X driver's composition pipeline (used for rotation,
      warp and blend, transformation matrices, etc) to also support stereo.
    - Fixed a bug where GetTexSubImage() would read incorrect data into
      a pixel buffer object when supplied with a target of
      GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY and a non-zero yoffset value.
    - Added support for generic active stereo with in-band DisplayPort
      signaling. The X configuration option "InbandStereoSignaling" is
      deprecated in favor of this stereo mode. See "Appendix B. X Config
      Options" in the README for more information.
    - Modified the driver to avoid restoring framebuffer console modes

nvidia-graphics-drivers (387.34-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream short lived branch release 387.34 (2017-11-24).
    (Closes: #881164)
    - Fixed a bug that caused Vulkan X11 swapchains to fail on GPUs without a
      display engine, such as some Tesla-branded graphics cards and some Optimus
      laptops.
    - Fixed a bug that caused fullscreen Vulkan applications to hang on some
      Kepler GPUs, such as the GeForce GTX 680.
    - Fixed a bug where the G-SYNC indicator was reporting "normal" instead
      of "G-SYNC" on Vulkan applications when G-SYNC was enabled.
  * New upstream short lived branch release 387.22 (2017-10-30).
    - Fixed a regression that could cause driver errors when setting modes
      that include DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport devices.
    - Added an nvidia.ko kernel module parameter, NVreg_EnableBacklightHandler,
      which can be used to enable experimental handling of laptop backlight
      brightness through /sys/class/backlight/. This handler overrides the
      ACPI-based one provided by the video.ko kernel module.
      NVreg_EnableBacklightHandler is disabled by default.
    - Added G-SYNC to all supported Vulkan swapchains for Maxwell and up.
      G-SYNC is enabled by default when using G-SYNC-ready monitors.  For
      direct-to-display swapchains, an application profile with "GLGSYNCAllowed"
      setting set to 'false' can be used to disable this feature:
        {
          "rules" : [
            { "pattern" : [], "profile" : [ "GLGSYNCAllowed", false ] }
          ]
        }
  * New upstream beta 387.12 (2017-10-03).
    - Fixed a regression that caused some display connectors on some GPUs to not
      report a connected HDMI or DisplayPort audio device even if the connected
      monitor supports audio.
    - Fixed a race condition that could lead to crashes when OpenGL programs
      manipulated vertex buffer objects from multiple threads simultaneously.
    - Improved performance of fullscreen Vulkan applications using X11
      swapchains.  This optimization will cause more events that trigger
      an out-of-date swapchain, such as when entering or leaving
      fullscreen mode.  (This is commonly encountered when using the
      alt-tab key combination, for example.)   Applications that do not
      properly respond to the VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR return code may
      not function properly when these events occur.  See section 30.8
      of the Vulkan specification.
    - Added support for YUV 4:2:0 compression for monitors connected via
      DisplayPort in configurations where either the display or GPU is
      incapable of driving the current mode in RGB 4:4:4.  See the
      description in the "Programming Modes" appendix for details.
    - Added framebuffer console hot plug handling to nvidia-modeset.
      Note that hot plugging is only handled when nvidia-modeset is initialized;
      for example, when Xorg or nvidia-persistenced is running or when
      nvidia-drm is loaded with the "modeset=1" parameter.
    - Added an "AllowGSYNC" MetaMode attribute that can be used to disable
      G-SYNC completely. This can be use to allow enabling features that are
      incompatible with G-SYNC, such as Ultra Low Motion Blur or Frame Lock.
    - Fixed several problems that prevented the "cc_version_check" sanity
      test from running correctly when building the NVIDIA kernel modules.
      As these problems would have masked mismatches between the compiler
      versions used to build the kernel and the NVIDIA kernel modules for
      an extended period of time, nvidia-installer has been updated to
      ignore CC version mismatches by default when they are detected.
    - Tiled monitors formerly resulted in a separate Xinerama screen being
      reported for each tile. They will now, by default, be combined into a
      single large Xinerama screen.
    - The individual panels in a tiled monitor will now be arranged based
      on the layout information provided in the monitor's EDID. This can be
      overridden by either manually specifying offsets or using the
      "MetaModeOrientation" option.
    - Disabled interlaced modes over DisplayPort by default due to incomplete
      support in the GPU. Added "AllowDpInterlaced" mode validation token to
      override this default behavior and allow interlaced modes over
      DisplayPort protocol anyway.

    - Disabled OpenGL threaded optimizations by default under Xinerama.
  * New upstream beta 378.09 (2017-01-18).
    - Added support for the ARB_parallel_shader_compile extension to allow
      multi-threaded compilation of GLSL shaders.
    - Updated the X driver to ignore any Virtual Reality Head Mounted
      Displays (HMDs).  See the "AllowHMD" X configuration option in the
      README for details.
    - The driver will now advertise GLX FBConfigs with no depth bits on depth 30
      X screens.
    - Added support in nvidia-settings to view configured PRIME displays. To
      enable PRIME displays, see "Offloading Graphics Display with RandR 1.4"
      in the README.
    - Added infrastructure which enables the NVIDIA EGL driver to load EGL
      external platform libraries that add client-side support for new window
      systems, beyond the existing libnvidia-egl-wayland.so.1. For more
      details, see:
        - https://github.com/NVIDIA/eglexternalplatform
        - https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland
    - Added support for the following Vulkan extensions: VK_KHR_display,
      VK_KHR_display_swapchain.
    - Enabled OpenGL threaded optimizations by default in the driver. Refer to
      the "Threaded Optimizations" section in the "Specifying OpenGL Environment
      Variable Settings" chapter of the README for details.  These optimizations
      will self-disable when they are degrading performance.  As a result,
      performance should be unchanged for many applications, and increased for
      those that benefit from threaded optimizations and were not already
      forcing them enabled.

  * New upstream beta 370.23 (2016-08-15).
    - Added the ability to over- and under-clock certain GeForce
      GPUs in the GeForce GTX 1000 series and later.  For GPUs that allow it,
      an offset can be applied to clock values in some clock domains of
      all performance levels.  This clock manipulation is done at the
      user's own risk.  See the README documentation of the "CoolBits"
      X configuration option for more details.
    - Implemented initial support for PRIME Synchronization to synchronize
      flipping between an NVIDIA PRIME display source and a separate PRIME

    (Closes: #833615)
    - Fixed a regression that could cause console corruption when resuming
      from suspend.
    - Improved buffer write performance of the nvidia-drm DRM KMS driver by
      using write-combined DRM Dumb Buffers where available.
    - Fixed a bug that caused X to crash when applying changes to the RandR

      when starting some versions of MATLAB.
    - Fixed OpenGL presentation to SDI through the GLX_NV_video_out and
      GLX_NV_present_video extensions, which was broken by the introduction
      of the nvidia-modeset kernel module in 358.09.
    - Fixed a bug that caused an incorrect offset to be applied when using
      the full composition pipeline on a display whose image has both a
      rotation and a ViewportOut offset applied.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause crashes in OpenGL applications which use
      glTextureView() with a non-zero minimum level.
    - Fixed a bug that caused hangs when a G-SYNC monitor is unplugged and a
      non-G-SYNC monitor is connected while G-SYNC is active.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (364.19-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream short lived branch release 364.19 (2016-04-22).
    - Fixed some locking issues in libnvidia-egl-wayland.so.
    - Fixed several libnvidia-egl-wayland.so interaction problems with
      buffer management Wayland protocols.
  * New upstream beta 364.15 (2016-04-06).
    - Fixed several EGL driver interaction problems with resizing windows
      in Wayland.
    - Fixed a bug that caused some DRM PRIME configurations to fail when
      DRM KMS was enabled (i.e., nvidia-drm.ko's modeset kernel module
      parameter was set to "1").
    - Fixed a bug that could cause a kernel crash when VDPAU was used
      while DRM KMS was enabled.
  * New upstream beta 364.12 (2016-03-21).
    - Changed the default OpenGL installation type to use the GLVND GLX
      client libraries rather than the legacy non-GLVND libraries.
    - Added initial support for Direct Rendering Manager Kernel
      Modesetting (DRM KMS).  See the DRM KMS section of the README for
      details.
    - Added a new kernel module, nvidia-drm.ko, which registers as a DRM
      driver with both PRIME and DRM KMS support.
    - Added support for the following EGL extensions:
        EGL_EXT_platform_wayland
      to enable Wayland applications to run on NVIDIA's EGL implementation,
        EGL_WL_bind_wayland_display
      to enable Wayland compositors to run on NVIDIA's EGL implementation, and
        EGL_EXT_device_drm
        EGL_EXT_output_drm
        EGL_EXT_stream_consumer_egloutput
      to enable Mir and Wayland compositors to display their content
      through EGLDevice, EGLOutput, and EGLstreams.
    - Added a Wayland platform library, libnvidia-egl-wayland.so, to allow
      Wayland compositors that support EGLDevice, EGLOutput, and EGLstreams
      to share EGL buffers with Wayland applications.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect frame rate reporting on Quadro
      Sync configurations with multiple GPUs.
    - Added support for the Vulkan API version 1.0.
    - Improved X colormap precision from 8 significant bits to 11 on GeForce
      GPUs.  Quadro GPUs already used 11 bits of precision.
    - Added a new RandR property, CscMatrix, which specifies a 3x4 color-space
      conversion matrix.  The matrix is applied after the X colormap and before
      the gamma ramp.  This property is available on GF119 and newer GPUs.
    - Improved handling of the X gamma ramp on GF119 and newer GPUs.  On these
      GPUs, the RandR gamma ramp is always 1024 entries and now applies to the
      cursor and VDPAU or workstation overlays in addition to the X root window.
    - Reworked how the NVIDIA driver registers with the Linux
      kernel's DRM subsystem for PRIME support.  As a result, PRIME
      support requires Linux kernel version 3.13 or newer (previously,
      PRIME support required Linux kernel version 3.10 or newer).
    - Improved the interactivity of applications that use a hardware cursor
      while G-SYNC is active.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (361.45.18-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream long lived branch release 361.45.18 (2016-06-28).
    - Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-smi to report an inaccurate version
      number.
  * New upstream long lived branch release 361.45.11 (2016-05-24).
    - Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented flipping from being enabled on
      systems with multiple displays.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause applications to crash when using the
      EGL_EXT_platform_device extension on a system with multiple GPUs.
    - The NVIDIA Unified Virtual Memory kernel module, nvidia-uvm.ko, now
      has a minimum kernel requirement of Linux 2.6.32. On older kernel
      versions, nvidia-uvm.ko will be compiled as a stub kernel module
      which does not provide any functionality.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: Tesla M40 24GB, Quadro M5500,
      Quadro M2000
    - Updated the libglvnd snapshot included in the NVIDIA driver
      package to libglvnd commit b7d75429677eecc00c3701aaa4deac1304bc51ff.
      This contains a new revision of the libglvnd ABI. The driver is not
      compatible with a libglvnd older than commit
      c5bcda3b848fe52d6ae6ef25c917431c06d62d27.
  * New upstream long lived branch release 361.42 (2016-03-30).
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce 920MX, GeForce 930MX,
      Quadro M6000 24GB.
    - Limited the default concurrency level in nvidia-settings to 32, to avoid
      hitting the maximum tasks limit on systems with many CPUs.
    - Fixed a regression that caused GPU exceptions and incorrect rendering
      when using pbuffers with EGLDevice.
    - Fixed a regression that caused the HSync and VSync mode timing polarity
      flags to be inverted.
  * New upstream long lived branch release 361.28 (2016-02-09).
    (Closes: #814347)
    - Added support for the following GPU: GeForce 945A.
    - Added a legacy, non-GLVND libGL.so GLX client library to the NVIDIA
      Linux driver installer package, and the ability to select between a
      GLVND or non-GLVND GLX client library at installation time. This
      allows users to install the legacy non-GLVND GLX client library in
      order to work around compatibility issues which may arise due to GLX
      applications which depend upon behaviors of the NVIDIA GLX client
      driver which are not defined by the Linux OpenGL ABI version 1.0.
      Please contact the vendors of any applications
      that are not compatible with GLVND to ensure that their applications
      be updated for compatibility with GLVND.
  * New upstream beta 361.18 (2016-01-13).
  * New upstream beta 361.16 (2016-01-05).
    - The OpenGL Vendor-Neutral Driver (GLVND) infrastructure is now included
      and supported by the NVIDIA GLX and OpenGL drivers.  This should not
      cause any visible changes in behavior for end users, but some internal
      driver component libraries have been renamed and/or moved as a result.
      These changes may affect scripts that rely on the presence of NVIDIA
      OpenGL driver components other than those specified in the Linux OpenGL
      ABI version 1.0, maintainers of alternative NVIDIA driver installation
      packages, and applications which rely on the presence of any non-
      OpenGL/GLX symbols in the libGL.so.1 library and its dependencies in
      any way.
      Please see:
        https://github.com/NVIDIA/libglvnd
      For more information on the GLVND project.
      The Linux OpenGL ABI version 1.0 specification is available at:
        https://www.opengl.org/registry/ABI
  * New upstream release 352 series.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (358.16-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream short lived branch release 358.16 (2015-11-20).
    (Closes: #819042)
    * Fixed CVE-2015-7869: Unsanitized User Mode Input.  (Closes: #805917)
      https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3808
    - Fixed a regression, introduced in 358.09, that caused incorrect
      rendering of OpenGL stereo applications in combination with
      Quadro Sync on certain GPUs.
    - Fixed a regression, introduced in 358.09, that caused OpenGL
      stereo applications to hang when SLI AFR, SFR, or SLIAA modes
      were enabled.
    - Fixed a regression, introduced in 358.09, that caused the
      system to hang while launching OpenGL applications when some SLI
      Mosaic topologies were in use.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause some G-SYNC monitors to flicker on
      Kepler-based GPUs when running at low frame rates.
    - Fixed a regression that could cause OpenGL or VDPAU applications to
      hang in Xinerama layouts which include multiple X screens that are
      driven by the same GPU.
    - Fixed a regression from 358.09 that caused G-SYNC monitors configured to
      use 3D Vision stereo to go blank and report an unsupported signal.
    - Fixed a regression from 358.09 that caused OpenGL applications that failed
      to negotiate permission to perform glXSwapBuffers via flipping to stop
      updating the screen.  This was triggered on Fedora 22 where the SELinux
      system policy prevents gnome-shell from communicating with the X server.
      Now, OpenGL applications that fail to negotiate flipping will fall back to
      glXSwapBuffers via blitting.
      See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1271401 for more details.
  * New upstream beta 358.09 (2015-10-12).
    - Fixed a regression that reduced OpenGL performance on headless X
      server configurations.
    - Fixed a memory leak that occurred after destroying a GLXWindow which
      still has the current context attached to it.
    - Fixed a bug which caused EGL pbuffers to be created with both a front
      and back buffer, instead of a back buffer only, as is required for EGL.
    - Added a new kernel module, nvidia-modeset.ko.  This new driver
      component works in conjunction with the nvidia.ko kernel module
      to program the display engine of the GPU.
      nvidia-modeset.ko does not provide any new user-visible
      functionality or interfaces to third party applications.  However,
      in a later release, nvidia-modeset.ko will be used as a basis for
      the modesetting interface provided by the kernel's direct rendering
      manager (DRM).
    - Reduced flickering and delays when transitioning into or out of G-SYNC
      mode.  As part of this change, monitors that have G-SYNC indicators in
      their on-screen displays will now always report that they are in G-SYNC
      mode.  The OpenGL G-SYNC visual indicator can be enabled in
      nvidia-settings to determine when G-SYNC is actually being used.
    - GLX protocol for the following OpenGL
      extension from OpenGL 3.0 has been promoted from
      unofficial to ARB approved official status:
        GL_EXT_draw_buffers2
    - GLX protocol for the following OpenGL 3.0 commands:
        BindBufferRangeNV, BindBufferBaseNV, BeginTransformFeedbackNV,
        EndTransformFeedbackNV, GetTransformFeedbackVaryingEXT,
        TransformFeedbackVaryingsEXT
      which are part of the following extensions:
        GL_NV_transform_feedback, GL_EXT_transform_feedback
      has been promoted from unofficial to ARB approved
      official status.
      With the above changes, GLX protocol for
      OpenGL 3.0 has been promoted from unofficial
      to ARB approved official status.
    - Added a new system memory allocation mechanism for large
      allocations in the OpenGL driver.  This mechanism allows unmapping
      the allocation from the process when it is not in use, making more
      virtual address space available to the application.  It is enabled
      by default on 32 bit OpenGL applications with Linux 3.11+ and glibc
      2.19+.  Memory allocated this way will consume space in /dev/shm.
      Setting the environment variable __GL_DevShmPageableAllocations
      to 2 will disable this feature.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (355.11-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 355.11 (2015-08-31). (Closes: #804547)
    - Fixed a bug that could cause GPU exceptions when using glReadPixels()
      on the depth or stencil buffers of multisample windows while resizing
      or moving the windows.
  * New upstream beta 355.06 (2015-08-03).
    - Fixed a bug that could cause data from one texture level to overwrite
      data from the next lowest level, when creating a texture view that
      did not include the higher of the two levels.
    - Corrected some erroneous reporting of support for GLX extensions:
      several extensions were being reported as supported for indirect
      GLX, which were in fact only supported under direct rendering.
    - Added support for the following EGL extensions:
        EGL_KHR_swap_buffers_with_damage, EGL_NV_stream_consumer_gltexture_yuv
    - Replaced the build system for the NVIDIA kernel modules and updated
      the installer package and nvidia-installer to use the new build
      system and kernel module source code layout. For more information
      about the new build system and layout, see the README document at:
      ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/packaging/linux/new-kbuild-for-355/
    - Added experimental full OpenGL support to EGL.
    - Marked the DeleteUnusedDP12Displays option as deprecated.
      Version 1.5.0 of the X Resize and Rotate specification added a note that
      dynamically-created outputs will not be destroyed, so this option is
      deprecated and will be removed in a future driver release.
    - Added support for VDPAU profiles added in VDPAU 0.9:
        VDP_DECODER_PROFILE_H264_BASELINE,
        VDP_DECODER_PROFILE_H264_CONSTRAINED_BASELINE,
        VDP_DECODER_PROFILE_H264_EXTENDED,
        VDP_DECODER_PROFILE_H264_PROGRESSIVE_HIGH,
        VDP_DECODER_PROFILE_H264_CONSTRAINED_HIGH
    - Fixed a bug that prevented more than one RandR output from sharing
      user-added modes.
    - Fixed a bug that caused application-specified swap intervals to be
      ignored on some screens when using Xinerama.
    - Fixed a bug that caused user-supplied RandR modes with nonsensical
      combinations of the +HSync, -HSync, +VSync, and -VSync flags to corrupt
      the mode list.
    - Added support to make an OpenGL 3.0 and above context current without
      making current to any drawable.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (352.21-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 352.21 (2015-06-15). (Closes: #793079)
    - Fixed a bug that caused the kernel to report errors when unmapping
      DMA allocations on kernels with CONFIG_DEBUG_DMA_API enabled.
    - Added GLX Protocol support for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_ARB_copy_buffer
      GL_ARB_texture_buffer_object
    - Fixed a bug that caused a kernel crash if SLI Mosaic and G-SYNC were used
      at the same time on a configuration with more display devices connected to
      one GPU than another.
  * New upstream beta 352.09 (2015-05-18).
    - Added the ability to configure the swapping behavior for quad-buffered
      stereo visuals. The driver can be configured to independently swap
      each eye as it becomes ready, to wait for both eyes to complete
      rendering before swapping, or to allow applications to specify which
      of these two behaviors is preferred by setting the swap interval.
      This setting can be adjusted in the nvidia-settings control panel, or
      via the NV-CONTROL API.
    - Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented OpenGL sampler objects from
      being properly deallocated when destroying OpenGL contexts.
    - Fixed a bug that caused GLX_EXT_framebuffer_sRGB to incorrectly report
      sRGB support in 30 bit-per-pixel framebuffer configurations.
    - Added support for G-SYNC with sync-to-vblank disabled. This allows
      applications to use G-SYNC to eliminate tearing for frame rates below the
      monitor's maximum refresh rate but allow tearing above the maximum refresh
      rate in order to minimize latency.
      When G-SYNC is active and sync-to-vblank is enabled, the frame rate is
      limited to the monitor's maximum refresh rate.
    - GLSL gl_Fog.scale is now +infinity when gl_Fog.end equals gl_Fog.start.
      Previously, the value 0 was used, but this broke certain
      applications such as the game XIII running on Wine (Wine bug #37068).
    - Enabled G-SYNC by default when Unified Back Buffer (UBB) is disabled.
    - Updated the NVIDIA GPU driver to avoid using video memory already
      in use by vesafb.

  * New upstream short-lived branch release 349.16 (2015-04-14).
  * New upstream beta 349.12 (2015-03-25).
    - Added support for G-SYNC monitors when used together with non-G-SYNC
      monitors.  When G-SYNC is enabled, non-G-SYNC monitors will display with
      tearing.
    - Removed the "EnableACPIHotkeys" X configuration option. This option
      has been deprecated and disabled by default since driver version 346.35.
      On modern Linux systems, display change hotkey events are delivered to
      the desktop environment as key press events, and the desktop environment
      handles the display change by issuing requests through the X Resize and
      Rotate extension (RandR).
    - Added support for lossless H.264/AVC video streams to VDPAU.
    - Added support for VDPAU Feature Set F to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver.
      GPUs with VDPAU Feature Set F are capable of hardware-accelerated
      decoding of H.265/HEVC video streams.
    - Added support for the X.Org X server's "-background none" option. When
      enabled, the NVIDIA driver will try to copy the framebuffer console's
      contents out of /dev/fb0.  If that cannot be done, then the screen is
      cleared to black.
    - Added support for YUV 4:2:0 compression to enable HDMI 2.0 4K@60Hz modes
      when either the display or GPU is incapable of driving these modes in
      RGB 4:4:4.  See NoEdidHDMI2Check in the README for details.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause multi-threaded applications to crash when
      multiple threads used the EGL driver at the same time.
    - Fixed a bug that caused Sync to VBlank to not work correctly with XVideo
      applications in certain configurations.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the X driver from correctly interpreting
      some X configuration options when a display device name was given
      with a GPU UUID qualifier.

    - Fixed Pixel Buffer Object operations when row length is less than
      width. GL_[UN]PACK_ROW_LENGTH can be set to a value lower than the

    - Fixed a bug that could cause rendering corruption in GLX clients using
      PBOs and/or VBOs when using GLX indirect rendering.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause glXSwapBuffers() to block for longer than
      necessary in multi-threaded GLX applications using the
      GLX_NV_delay_before_swap extension.
    - Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications using the NV_path_rendering

    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort audio to stop working after monitors
      are hotplugged.
  * New upstream release 346.35 (2015-01-16).
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce 800A, GeForce 800M.
    - Updated the NVIDIA X driver to reject frame packed interlaced HDMI 3D
      modes during mode validation. These modes were being validated by the
      driver, despite never having been supported.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the console from being restored after
      forcefully terminating X, on some GPUs with multiple DisplayPort
      monitors attached. This bug also subsequently prevented X from being
      started following the failed console restoration.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the ACPI hotkey mask to be set incorrectly on some
      laptops even when the EnableACPIHotkeys option is disabled.
    - Disabled the EnableACPIHotkeys option by default.  This option is now
      considered deprecated and will be removed in a future driver release.  On
      modern Linux systems, display change hotkey events are delivered to the
      desktop environment as key press events, and the desktop environment
      handles the display change by issuing requests through the X Resize and
      Rotate extension (RandR).

    - Fixed a bug that caused an incorrect DisplayPort link configuration
      to be displayed after a hotplug or unplug.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce GTX 970M, GeForce GTX 980M.
    - Added support for decoding VP8 video streams using the NVCUVID API
      on GPUs with VP8 hardware decode support.
    - Added support for the following EGL extensions: EGL_EXT_device_base,
      EGL_EXT_platform_device, EGL_EXT_output_base.
    - Added the ability to increase the operating voltage on certain
      GeForce GPUs in the GeForce GTX 400 series and later. Voltage
      adjustments are done at the user's own risk. See the documentation
      on the "CoolBits" X configuration option in the README for details.
    - Added support for NVENC on GeForce GPUs. For more details on the
      NVENC SDK, see:

      (Closes: #886852)
    - Fixed a compatibility problem between the nvidia.ko's Page Attribute
      Table (PAT) support and the kernel Page Table Isolation (PTI) patches.
      To optimize stores to memory, nvidia.ko contains support for
      configuring the CPU's PAT registers, as a fallback for Linux kernels
      that predate kernel native PAT support.  On any recent kernel
      with CONFIG_X86_PAT enabled, the driver will detect that setup has
      already been done and skip its PAT setup.  However, a static inline
      function called by nvidia.ko's PAT fallback support was updated in
      the PTI patches to use the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL symbol 'cpu_tlbstate'.
      nvidia.ko was updated to only contain its PAT fallback support,
      at build time, on kernels without CONFIG_X86_PAT.
    * Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (337.19-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream beta 337.17 (2014-05-01).
    - Fixed a bug causing mode validation to fail for 4K resolutions over HDMI
      in certain situations.
    - Added support for the GLX_EXT_stereo_tree extension.  For more
      details, see the extension specification:
        http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/glx_stereo_tree.txt
    - Enabled support for using Unified Back Buffer (UBB) and 3D Stereo with
      the composite extension on Quadro cards.  Using stereo with a composite
      manager requires a stereo-aware composite manager.  Otherwise, only the
      left eye of stereo applications will be displayed.  See the
      GLX_EXT_stereo_tree extension specification for more details.
  * New upstream beta 337.12 (2014-04-08).
    - Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL programs to freeze under some
      low memory conditions.
    - Removed the "OnDemandVBlankInterrupts" X configuration option: this
      option has been enabled by default since version 177.68 of the
      NVIDIA Unix driver, and the documentation had not been updated to
      reflect the new default value.
    - Fixed a bug that caused GPU errors when hotplugging daisy-chained
      DisplayPort 1.2 displays.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the use of multiple simultaneous X servers
      on UEFI systems.
    - Added the ability to over- and under-clock certain GeForce
      GPUs in the GeForce GTX 400 series and later.  For GPUs that allow it,
      an offset can be applied to clock values in some clock domains of
      some performance levels.  This clock manipulation is done at the
      user's own risk.  See the README documentation of the "CoolBits"
      X configuration option for more details.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce 830M, GeForce 840M,
      GeForce 845M, GeForce GTX 850M.
    - Renamed the RandR output property _GUID to GUID now that it is an official
      property documented in randrproto.txt:
        https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/randrproto/commit/?id=19fc4c5a72eb9919d720ad66734029d9f8e313b1
    - Reduced CPU utilization and GPU memory utilization of the NVIDIA
      EGL driver.
    - Added support for the following EGL extensions:
      - EGL_EXT_buffer_age;
      - EGL_EXT_client_extensions;
      - EGL_EXT_platform_base;
      - EGL_EXT_platform_x11.
    - Renamed the "Clone" setting of the "MetaModeOrientation" X configuration
      option to "SamePositionAs", to make clear that this setting applies to
      the position only, and not to the resolution of modes in the MetaMode.
    - Added NV-CONTROL attribute NV_CTRL_VIDEO_ENCODER_UTILIZATION to query
      utilization percentage of the video encoder engine.
    - Added support for the GLX_NV_delay_before_swap extension.  For more
      details, see the extension specification:
        http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/NV/glx_delay_before_swap.txt
    - Report correct buffer sizes for RGB GLX visuals, GLXFBConfigs, and
      EGLConfigs.  Previously, RGB10 and RGB8 formats were reported as having 32
      bits, and RGB5 formats were reported as having 16 bits.  Now they are
      correctly reported as 30, 24, and 15 bit formats respectively as
      required by the GLX and EGL specifications.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (334.21-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream short lived branch release 334.21 (2014-03-03).
    - Fixed a regression in the NVIDIA kernel module which caused it to
      improperly dereference a userspace pointer. This potential security
      issue was initially reported to the public at:
        https://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=3922
      The regression did not affect NVIDIA GPU drivers before release 334.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL programs to hang after calling
      fork(2).
    - Fixed a bug that could cause a multi-threaded OpenGL application
      to crash when one of its threads exits after the application has
      unloaded libGL.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce GTX 750 Ti,
      GeForce GTX 750, GeForce GTX 745, GeForce GTX TITAN Black.
    - Added support for GPUs with VDPAU Feature Set E. See the README
      for details.
    - On GPUs with VDPAU Feature Set E, VDPAU now supports more robust
      decode error handling at the cost of a minor performance impact.
      This can be disabled by setting the
      VDPAU_NVIDIA_DISABLE_ERROR_CONCEALMENT environment variable to 1.
    - Added support for application profile rule patterns which are logical
      operations of subpatterns. See the README for details.
    - Added support for a "findfile" application profile feature which
      allows the driver to apply profiles based on matching files in the
      same directory as the process executable. See the README for details.
    - Improved performance of OpenGL applications when used in conjunction
      with the X driver's composition pipeline.  The composition pipeline may
      be explicitly enabled by using the ForceCompositionPipeline or
      ForceFullCompositionPipeline MetaMode options, or implicitly enabled
      when certain features such as some XRandR transformations, rotation,
      Warp & Blend, PRIME, and NvFBC are used.
  * New upstream short lived branch release 334.16 (2014-02-08).
    - Fixed a bug that could cause applications using the OpenGL
      extension ARB_query_buffer_object to crash under Xinerama.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause poor stereo synchronization in large
      multi-monitor setups using 3D Vision, due to failed hardware
      handshaking on some of the monitors.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented some DisplayPort 1.2 displays from being
      properly restored after a VT switch.
    - Renamed per GPU proc directories in /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/ with GPU's
      bus location represented in "domain:bus:device.function" format.
    - Added 64-bit EGL and OpenGL ES libraries to 64-bit driver prackages.
    - Changed format of "Bus Location" field reported in the
      /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/0..N/information files from
      "domain:bus.device.function" to "domain:bus:device.function" to match
      the lspci format.
    - Fixed a bug in the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension where incorrect
      ages would be returned unless triple buffering was enabled.
    - Updated the NVIDIA X driver to load the NVIDIA kernel module using
      `nvidia-modprobe`, rather than the XFree86 DDX helper function
      xf86LoadKernelModule().
    - Changed the driver's default behavior to stop deleting RandR 1.2 outputs
      corresponding to unused DisplayPort 1.2 devices.  Deleting these outputs
      can confuse some applications.  Added a new option,
      DeleteUnusedDP12Displays, which can be used to turn this behavior back on.
      This option can be enabled by running
        sudo nvidia-xconfig --delete-unused-dp12-displays
    - Improved support for the __GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE and
      VDPAU_NVIDIA_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE environment variables in certain
      configurations.  Both environment variables will now recognize all
      supported display device names.  See "Appendix C. Display Device Names"
      and "Appendix G. VDPAU Support" in the README for more details.
    - Improved performance of the X driver when handling large numbers of
      surface allocations.
  * Update nv-readme.ids.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Build the EGL/GLES packages for amd64, too.
  * Update lintian overrides.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (331.38-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream long lived branch release 331.38 (2014-01-13).
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if video memory is
      exhausted and the GPU does not support rendering to system memory.
    - Improved the robustness of the NVIDIA X driver in scenarios where
      GPU-accessible memory for allocating pixmaps was exhausted.
    - Added NV-CONTROL attributes to control the brightness of the illuminated
      logos on certain graphics boards.  For example, to turn off the
      illumination of the "GEFORCE GTX" lettering on the GeForce GTX 780, use
        nvidia-settings --assign GPULogoBrightness=0
    - Fixed a bug that prevented screen transformations from being
      applied properly when starting X.
    - GLX protocol for the following OpenGL extensions from
      OpenGL 2.1 and OpenGL 3.0 have been promoted from
      unofficial to ARB approved official status:
      GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object, GL_NV_conditional_render,
      GL_ARB_map_buffer_range, GL_EXT_texture_integer,
      GL_ARB_vertex_array_object.
      GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object was the last piece of protocol
      needed to have official support for indirect rendering with
      all OpenGL 2.1 commands.
    - GLX Protocol for the miscellaneous OpenGL 3.0 commands not
      associated with specific extensions has also been promoted from
      unofficial to ARB approved status.
    - Deprecated display mask related configuration of display devices via
      NV-CONTROL and nvidia-settings.  Display target specifications should
      be used instead - A display target is one of the display's valid names,
      with an optional GPU or X screen qualifier.
    - Deprecated the following NV-CONTROL attributes:
      NV_CTRL_CONNECTED_DISPLAYS, NV_CTRL_ENABLED_DISPLAYS,
      NV_CTRL_ASSOCIATED_DISPLAYS, NV_CTRL_NOTEBOOK_INTERNAL_LCD,
      NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTER, NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVES,
      NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTERABLE, NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVEABLE.
      Also, although NV_CTRL_PROBE_DISPLAYS is still operational, the return
      value has been deprecated and should not be used.
    * Fixed signal mask corruption.  (Closes: #728743)
  * conftest.h: Implement new conftest.sh functions kbasename,
    fatal_signal_pending (331.38).
  * Merge changes from 319.82-1.
  * Add xorg-video-abi-15 as alternative dependency.  (Closes: #732118)

    New packages for EGL, OpenGL|ES 1.x, OpenGL|ES 2.x.
    These packages do not yet utilize the diversion/alternatives system,
    so you need to add /usr/lib/<triplet>/nvidia/current to LD_LIBRARY_PATH to

nvidia-graphics-drivers (331.17-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta 331.17 (2013-10-22).
    - Added support for NVIDIA OpenGL-based Framebuffer Capture (NvFBCOpenGL).
      This library provides a high performance, low latency interface to
      capture and optionally encode the composited framebuffer of an X screen.
      NvFBC and NvIFR are private APIs that are only available to approved
      partners for use in remote graphics scenarios.  Please contact NVIDIA
      at GRIDteam@nvidia.com for more information.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented configuration files containing application
      profiles from being loaded when directories were present in the
      application profile configuration search path.
    - Deferred initialization of libselinux in the NVIDIA OpenGL driver, in
      order to avoid a problem where libselinux might not be ready when the
      NVIDIA libGL shared library is first loaded.
    - Added nvidia-uvm.ko, the NVIDIA Unified Memory kernel module, to the
      NVIDIA Linux driver package. This kernel module provides support for
      the new Unified Memory feature in an upcoming CUDA release.
  * Update nv-readme.ids.
  * not-silent.patch: Refresh.
  * conftest.h:
    - Remove obsolete conftest.sh functions vma_prio_tree_foreach,

nvidia-graphics-drivers (331.13-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta 331.13 (2013-10-04).  (Closes: #727128)
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to fail to initialize when
      DisplayPort 1.2 monitors were assigned to separate X screens on the same
      GPU.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause a deadlock when forking from OpenGL
      programs which use some malloc implementations, such as TCMalloc.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented Warp & Blend settings from being
      retained across display configuration changes.
    - Changed the clipping behavior of the NVIDIA X driver on Trapezoids
      and Triangles for some RENDER operations to match the behavior in
      newer versions of Pixman:
      https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pixman/2013-April/002755.html
    - Fixed a bug in MetaMode tracking that could cause spurious error
      messages to be printed when attempting to add or delete Metamodes
      via NV-CONTROL.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the NVIDIA X driver to attempt to load the
      X11 "shadow" module unconditionally, even in situations where the
      driver had no need to use the module. This could result in the
      printing of spurious error messages, on X servers where the module
      was not present.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented display configuration changes made
      with xvidtune(1) from working correctly.
    - Fixed a bug that occasionally caused display corruption in GLX
      applications while changing the display configuration.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented glReadPixels from working correctly when
      reading from Pixel Buffer Objects over indirect rendering, when the
      image width is not a multiple of 4.
    - Added a new NV-CONTROL attribute, NV_CTRL_BACKLIGHT_BRIGHTNESS,
      for controlling backlight brightness.
    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort 1.2 multi-stream devices to stop
      working if they were unplugged and plugged back in while they were active
      in the current MetaMode.
    - Added support for multiple NVIDIA kernel modules. This feature allows
      users to assign different GPUs in the system to different NVIDIA kernel
      modules, potentially reducing the software overhead of coordinating
      access to multiple GPUs.
    - Added support for the EGL API on 32-bit platforms.  Currently, the
      supported client APIs are OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0 and 3.0, and the only
      supported window system backend is X11.
    - Add a new option, AllowEmptyInitialConfiguration, which allows the X
      server to start even if no connected display devices are detected at
      startup.  This option can be enabled by running "sudo nvidia-xconfig
      --allow-empty-initial-configuration"
      This option is useful in RandR 1.4 display offload configurations where
      no display devices are connected to the NVIDIA GPU when the X server is
      started, but might be connected later.
    - Added a system memory cache to improve the performance of certain X
      rendering operations that use software rendering fallbacks.  The X
      configuration option "SoftwareRenderCacheSize" may be used to configure
      the size of the cache.
    - Removed the "DynamicTwinView" X configuration option: dynamic
      reconfiguration of displays is always possible, and can no longer be
      disabled.
  * Refresh patches.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Update lintian overrides.
  * nvidia-driver: Ship nvidia-debugdump.
  * conftest.h:
    - Implement checks for linux/printk.h, linux/ratelimit.h,
      linux/prio_tree.h (331.13).
    - Implement new conftest.sh functions vma_prio_tree_foreach,
      address_space_init_once, vm_operations_struct (331.13).

nvidia-graphics-drivers (325.08-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream short lived branch release 325.08 (2013-07-01).
    - Fixed a bug that could cause display flickering after setting some
      scaling configurations.
    - Changed the default PCIe interrupt delivery method from virtual-wire
      to MSI. Note that if the NVIDIA Linux driver fails to initialize
      with an error indicating that it is not receiving interrupts, MSI
      can be disabled by setting the module parameter "NVreg_EnableMSI=0"
      when loading the NVIDIA kernel module.
    - Removed support for Linux 2.4 kernels. The NVIDIA Linux driver now
      requires Linux 2.6.9 or later.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the creation of a mode via RandR with the
      same name as a previously created mode, even after the previous mode
      had been deleted.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications that use Frame Buffer
      Objects (FBOs) to crash following a mode switch (e.g. changing the
      resolution of a display or transforming it).
    - Fixed a memory leak that could be triggered by unloading libGL before
      destroying all GLX contexts.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause color correction settings to be applied to
      the wrong display when multiple displays are unplugged and then plugged
      back in again.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause a spurious error message about a missing
      NV-GLX extension when performing indirect rendering from a GLX client
      with the NVIDIA client-side OpenGL libraries to a non-NVIDIA GLX server.
    - Fixed an OpenGL bug that prevented conditional rendering from the
      NV_conditional_render extension from correctly affecting CopyPixels.
    - Improved the rendering performance of complex gradients.
    - Fixed an X driver bug where the RandR CRTC panning area and tracking
      area were not getting clamped to the current X screen size when
      the RandR CRTC transitioned from disabled to enabled.
    - Fixed an X driver bug where successful RandR X_RRSetScreenConfig
      requests would update the server's RandR 'lastSetTime' too far,
      potentially causing subsequent RandR requests to be unnecessarily
      rejected.
    - Fixed an X driver bug that caused GPUs to become inaccessible via
      the NV-CONTROL X extension when no corresponding X screens could be
      initialized.
    - Generate a BadMatch error when applications attempt to create GLX
      pixmaps using glXCreatePixmap() or glXCreateGLXPixmapWithConfigSGIX()
      and the pixmap's depth doesn't match that of the specified GLXFBConfig.
    - Honor a GPU UUID as the GPU qualifier for X configuration options that
      allow GPU qualifiers (e.g. "MetaModes").
    - Report GPU UUIDs in the X log when verbose logging is enabled in the
      X server.
    - Enabled conformant glBlitFrameBuffer() scissor test behavior by
      default. A driver-provided application profile enables the previous
      non-conformant behavior for applications that load libcogl, to work
      around a bug in older versions of libcogl.
      Application profiles can be added to enable the non-conformant behavior
      for other applications that depend upon it. See the "Known Issues"
      section of the README for more details.
  * Refresh patches.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Update lintian overrides.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (319.49-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream long lived branch release 319.49 (2013-08-20).
    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort monitors connected to Quadro FX 3800,
      4800, or 5800 to remain off after DPMS.
    - Added the NVIDIA OpenGL-based Inband Frame Readback (NvIFROpenGL) library
      to the Linux driver package. This library provides a high performance,
      low latency interface to capture and optionally encode an individual
      OpenGL framebuffer. NvIFROpenGL captures pixels rendered by OpenGL only
      and is ideally suited to application capture and remote access.
    - Fixed a bug that caused applications using CUDA-GL interoperability to
      crash when run on X servers with Xinerama enabled.
    - Fixed a bug that could prevent some double-bit ECC errors from being
      properly reported.
    - Fixed a bug which could cause a blank screen when changing house sync
      settings on Quadro Kepler GPUs with Quadro Sync boards.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented nested loops with identical loop conditions
      in GLSL shaders from terminating correctly. This could cause hangs in
      applications such as Exa PowerVIZ.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (319.32-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream long lived branch release 319.32 (2013-06-25).
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash after power-cycling
      displays connected behind a DisplayPort 1.2 Multi-Stream Transport hub.
    - Updated the application profile syntax to allow for multiple patterns
      within a single rule. See the README for details.
    - Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL programs to crash when the __GL_DOOM3
      environment variable was set.
    - Updated the NVIDIA driver to avoid calling fork(2) to execute the
      nvidia-modprobe utility when not needed.
    - Improved the error reporting of the nvidia-persistenced utility.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause Altair HyperView to hang when rendering
      animations with tensors.
    - Fixed a performance regression in MEDINA 8.2.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the OpenGL driver to hang sometimes when running
      the SpeedTree Modeler application.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause an OpenGL application to crash if it creates
      and destroys multiple threads.
    - Fixed a bug that caused corrupted window content in some cases when
      moving GLX windows with antialiasing enabled.
    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices that failed link training to
      be reported as connected rather than disconnected.
    - Fixed a regression that could cause a DisplayPort device that was
      connected to one connector to turn off when a DisplayPort device on a
      different connector was connected or disconnected.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce 710A, GeForce 720M.
    - On Kepler-based GPUs, improved the appearance of the tearing that occurs
      when using RandR 1.4's Source Output capability.  While tearing is still
      expected, the tears should now appear as horizontal lines rather than more
      noticeable checkerboard or triangular shapes.
  * New upstream long lived branch release 319.23 (2013-05-23).
    - Fixed a regression that could cause X to crash when querying GPU
      information through NV-CONTROL on multi-GPU systems where some
      GPUs failed to be initialized for X.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause X to crash when using Vertex
      Buffer Objects (VBOs) with indirect rendering.
    - Fixed RandR panning reporting when the current MetaMode is smaller
      than the X screen.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (319.17-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream long lived branch release 319.17 (2013-05-02).
    - Fixed a regression that caused multiple BUG messages to be printed in
      the kernel log on SMP systems.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash when repeatedly
      enabling and disabling displays.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce GT 720M, GeForce GT 735M,
      GeForce GT 740M, GeForce GT 745M, GeForce GT 750M, GeForce GTX 760M,
      GeForce GTX 765M, GeForce GTX 770M, GeForce GTX 775M, GeForce GTX 780M.
    - Added nvidia-persistenced, a daemon utility, to the driver package.
      nvidia-persistenced can be installed to run on system startup or
      manually run to allow the NVIDIA kernel module to keep persistent driver
      state allocated when no other user-space NVIDIA driver components are
      running.  This can improve startup time for other user-space NVIDIA
      driver components.
  * New upstream beta 319.12 (2013-04-09).
    - Added initial support for restoration of efifb consoles on UEFI
      systems where the primary display is driven over VGA or TMDS (e.g.
      DVI, HDMI, or LVDS).
    - Added support for the xorg.conf Monitor section options "Ignore",
      "Enable", "Primary", and "Rotate".  For example, to rotate a monitor
      identified by a specific EDID hash, one could add the following to
      /etc/X11/xorg.conf or a file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d:
        Section "Monitor"
          Identifier "DPY-EDID-ee6cecc0-fa46-0c33-94e0-274313f9e7eb"
          Option "Rotate" "left"
        EndSection
      See the README and the xorg.conf(5) man page for more information.
    - Added support for the following GPU: GeForce GTX 650 Ti BOOST.
    - Added support for application profiles to the NVIDIA client-side GLX
      implementation. See the "Application Profiles" chapter of the README for
      more information.
    - Added the "PanningTrackingArea" and "PanningBorder" MetaMode attributes.
    - Added support for RandR 1.3 panning.
    - Improved performance when the Accel option is disabled.
    - Added initial support for RandR 1.4 Provider objects with the Source
      Output capability, which can be used to render the desktop on an NVIDIA
      GPU and display it on an output connected to a provider with the Sink
      Output capability, such as an Intel integrated graphics device or a
      DisplayLink USB-to-VGA adapter.  See the README for details.
    - Added nvidia-modprobe, a setuid root utility, to the driver package.
      nvidia-modprobe can be used by user-space NVIDIA driver components
      to make sure the NVIDIA kernel module is loaded and that the
      NVIDIA character device files are present.  When possible,
      it is recommended to use Linux distribution native mechanisms
      for managing kernel module loading and device file creation.
      This utility is provided as a fallback to work out-of-the-box in
      a distribution-independent way.
    - Fixed a memory leak that occurred when destroying a GLX window
      but not its associated X window.
    - Improved the performance of modesets in cases where the mode
      timings remained the same, but other parameters of the mode
      configuration, such as the ViewPort or panning domain, changed.
    - Fixed an issue with RENDER convolution filters.  The driver will
      no longer normalize filter kernels before accelerating them.
    - Improved debuggability of the NVIDIA OpenGL libraries by
      including proper stack unwinding information on all supported
      architectures.
    - Updated the dkms.conf file and the makefile for the NVIDIA Linux
      kernel module to allow DKMS installations on systems with separate
      source and output directories.
    - Fixed a bug that caused RENDER Pictures to be sampled
      incorrectly when using nearest filtering in some cases.
    - Added support for the RandR "Border" and "BorderDimensions" Output
      properties, which can be used to configure the ViewPortOut of an
      RandR output.  This is functionally equivalent to the "ViewPortOut"
      MetaMode token.
    - Fixed a bug where RRGetCrtcInfo could report incorrect size
      information when an RandR output has a custom ViewPortIn.
    - Further improve performance of some versions of HyperMesh with
      Quadro GPUs.
    - Added support for dynamic mode management through RandR, e.g. via
      the --newmode, --rmmode, and --delmode options in xrandr(1).
    - Increased the number of pages that can be shared across multiple
      processes in the x86 build of libnvidia-glcore.so, by reducing its
      R_386_PC32 relocation count.
    - Fixed a bug that caused XVideo applications to receive BadAlloc errors
      after VT switches and mode switches that occurred while a composite
      manager was running.
    - Removed the X driver's support for "CursorShadow".
    - Switched .run package compression from gzip to xz.  This provides a
      higher level of compression.
  * Update nv-readme.ids.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Refresh use-nv-kernel.o.ARCH.patch. Remove frequently changing context.
  * nvidia-glx: Ship nvidia-persistenced.
  * nvidia-kernel-{source,dkms}: Provide dummy conftest/patches.h, too.
  * Rename package nvidia-cuda-proxy to nvidia-cuda-mps: Upstream has renamed
    the programs nvidia-cuda-proxy-* to nvidia-cuda-mps-*.
  * Rename metapackage nvidia-glx to nvidia-driver. Add transitional package.
  * conftest.h:
    - Implement check for drm/drmP.h (319.12).
    - Implement new conftest.sh function drm_available (319.12).

  * New upstream long lived branch release 310.40 (2013-03-08).
    - Reduced the amount of time needed to establish framelock in some
      stereo configurations with many monitors.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce G205M, GeForce GT 240M LE,
      GeForce 405M, GeForce 610, GeForce 615, GeForce 620M, GeForce GT 625M,
      GeForce GT 625 (OEM), GeForce GT 635, GeForce 705M, GeForce 710M,

  * New upstream long lived branch release 310.32 (2013-01-21).
    - Fixed a bug when enabling framelock between displays connected to
      the same GPU as other displays with different refresh rates, which
      caused the latter to be incorrectly assigned to the framelock group.
    - Updated the reporting of HDMI 3D framerates and pixel clocks to be
      more consistent with how they are reported by HDMI 3D displays.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause applications using GL_NV_vdpau_interop
      to crash during mode switches.
    - Fixed a regression that could cause OpenGL applications to crash
      while compiling shaders.
    - Added a kernel module parameter, "NVreg_EnablePCIeGen3", which can be
      used to enable PCIe gen 3 when possible. Note that on many systems
      where the NVIDIA driver does not allow PCIe gen 3 by default,
      stability problems can be expected when this option is enabled: users

nvidia-graphics-drivers (304.60-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream long lived branch release 304.60 (2012-10-18).
    - Fixed a bug that caused the EIZO FlexScan SX2762W monitor to remain blank
      when connected via DisplayPort.
    - Fixed a bug that caused applications to stop rendering or the X server to
      hang in Xinerama configurations when windows were moved, resized, mapped,
      or unmapped.
    - Fixed a bug that caused poor OpenGL performance on GeForce 6 and 7 PCI
      cards.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if a display was put into
      DPMS off mode and subsequently re-enabled while screen transformations
      are in use.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X Resize and Rotate extension to be enabled
      when Xinerama is enabled.  These two X extensions are incompatible and
      having them both enabled can confuse window managers such as KDE's kwin.
      RandR is now correctly disabled when Xinerama is enabled.
    - Fixed a bug causing OpenGL stereo applications to not work properly
      when using passive stereo modes 5 through 9 on Quadro Fermi and newer
      GPUs.
    - Added support for the "Backlight" RandR output property for
      configuring the brightness of some notebook internal panels.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the Ubuntu Unity launcher panel from
      revealing: https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1057000
    - Fixed a bug that caused incorrect input transformation after resizing
      an NVIDIA X screen with xserver ABI 12 (xorg-server 1.12) or newer.
    - Fixed a bug that caused GLX to leak memory when Xinerama is
      enabled.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (304.30-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta 304.30 (2012-07-30).
    - Added support for xserver ABI 13 (xorg-server 1.13).
    - Added support for RandR per-CRTC gamma manipulation through the
      RandR 1.2 RRGetCrtcGammaSize, RRGetCrtcGamma, and RRSetCrtcGamma
      requests.
    - Fixed a bug that caused RRSetOutputPrimary requests to incorrectly
      generate BadValue errors when setting the primary output to None.  This
      caused gnome-settings-daemon to crash after changing the screen
      configuration in response to a display hotplug or the display change
      hot-key being pressed.
    - Fixed a problem where RENDER Glyphs operations would exhibit severe
      performance issues in certain cases, such as when used with gradients
      by Cairo and Chromium.
    - Fixed a bug that caused X to hang when resuming certain DisplayPort
      display devices (such as Apple brand mini-DisplayPort to dual-link DVI
      adapters) from power-saving mode.
    - Added support for the following GPU: Tesla K10.
    - Fixed a bug that caused an X screen to be extended to Quadro SDI Output
      devices by default.  An X screen will still use an SDI Output device if
      it is the only display device available.  To use a SDI Output device on
      an X screen with other display devices available, include the SDI Output
      device with either the "UseDisplayDevice" or "MetaMode" X configuration
      options.
    - Updated X11 modeline validation such that modes not defined in a
      display device's EDID are discarded if the EDID 1.3 "GTF Supported"
      flag is unset or if the EDID 1.4 "Continuous Frequency" flag is
      unset.  The new "AllowNonEdidModes" token for the ModeValidation
      X configuration option can be used to disable this new check.
    - Fixed a bug, introduced in the 295.xx release series, with EDID
      detection on some laptop internal panels.  This bug caused the
      laptop internal panel to show six small copies of the desktop.
      (Closes: #681453)
    - Added support for FXAA, Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing.

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]

nvidia-graphics-drivers (304.22-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta 304.22 (2012-07-13).
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce GTX 680M, Quadro K1000M,
      Quadro K2000M.
    - Enhanced the functionality of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X
      configuration option:
      + Implicit MetaModes will be added for the primary display device,
        even if multiple display devices are in use when X is initialized.
      + Implicit MetaModes will be added for common resolutions, even
        if there isn't a mode with that resolution in the mode pool of
        the display device.
      + Extended the syntax of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X
        configuration option, e.g., to control which display device is
        used for creation of implicit MetaModes.
      See the description of the IncludeImplicitMetaModes X configuration
      option in the README for details.
    - Modified the handling of the RandR 1.0/1.1 requests RRGetScreenInfo
      and RRSetScreenConfig (e.g., `xrandr -q --q1` and `xrandr --size ...`
      and `xrandr --orientation ...`) such that they operate on MetaModes.
      This was the behavior in NVIDIA X driver versions 295.xx and
      earlier, but 302.xx releases altered the handling of these RandR
      1.0/1.1 requests to operate on a single RandR output's modes.
    - With the above changes to IncludeImplicitMetaModes and RandR 1.0/1.1
      handling, fullscreen applications (e.g., SDL-based applications,
      Wine), should have more resolutions available to them, and should
      interact better with multiple monitor configurations.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause G8x, G9x, and GT2xx GPUs to display a black
      screen or corruption after waking up from suspend.  (Closes: #679577)
    - Fixed several bugs that could cause some OpenGL programs to hang
      when calling fork(3).
    - Fixed an nvidia-settings bug that caused the results of ProbeDisplays
      queries made with the --display-device-string option to be formatted
      incorrectly.
    - Improved the responsiveness of updates to the nvidia-settings
      control panel when displays are hotplugged.
    - Fixed a bug that caused display corruption when setting some
      transforms, especially when panning a transformed display.
    - Fixed a bug that caused extra RandR events to be generated the first
      time a display is hotplugged.
    - Fixed a bug that caused X11 modelines with '@' in their names to
      be rejected.
    - Added support for DisplayPort 1.2 branch devices, which allow multiple
      displays to be connected to a single DisplayPort connector on a graphics
      board.
    - Fixed a bug that caused most OpenGL texture uploads to be slow when
      the context was bound rendering to an RGB overlay drawable.
    - Fixed a bug that caused audio over HDMI to not work after restarting
      the X server on some MCP7x (IGP) GPUs.
    - Updated the X configuration option "UseDisplayDevice" to honor the
      value "none" on any GPU.
    - Added support for DKMS in nvidia-installer. Installing the kernel
      module through DKMS allows the module to be rebuilt automatically
      when changing to a different Linux kernel. See the README and the
      nvidia-installer help text for the "--dkms" option.
    - Added RandR output properties _ConnectorLocation, ConnectorNumber,
      ConnectorType, EDID, _GUID, and SignalFormat.  See the README for details
      on these properties.
    - Extended support for Base Mosaic to all G80+ SLI configurations with up
      to three displays.
    - Fixed a bug that caused some monitors to fail to wake from DPMS suspend
      mode when multiple DisplayPort monitors were attached to one GPU.
    - Removed controls for XVideo attributes from the "X Server XVideo
      Settings" page of the nvidia-settings control panel. XVideo attributes
      can be configured in XVideo player applications, or through utilities
      such as xvattr.
    - Fixed a bug that caused all ports on an XVideo adaptor to share
      color correction settings.
    - Removed support for the following X configuration options:
         SecondMonitorHorizSync
         SecondMonitorVertRefresh
       Similar control is available through the NVIDIA HorizSync and
       VertRefresh X configuration options.  Please see the NVIDIA driver
       README for details.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro from working
      properly when switching between X servers on different VTs.
    * Closes: #682618

nvidia-graphics-drivers (302.17-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 302.17 (2012-06-15).
    - Made nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder consistent with the RRSetOutputPrimary
      and RRGetOutputPrimary RandR requests: changes to either
      nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder or RandR OutputPrimary will be reflected in
      the other.
    - Fixed an interaction problem between RandR 1.2, ConstrainCursor,
      and panning that prevented panning from working properly.
    - Fixed a bug that caused RandR RRNotify_CrtcChange events to not
      be generated when switching between MetaModes with the same total
      size but different layout of display devices.  This bug caused
      some window managers to not update their layouts in response to
      switching same-sized MetaModes.
    - Added support for desktop panning when rotation, reflection,
      or transformation is applied to a display device (either through
      RandR or through the MetaMode syntax); panning would previously be
      ignored in that case.
    - Added an "EDID" property to RandR 1.2 outputs.  This property contains the
      binary contents of the connected monitor's extended display identification
      data, which allows applications such as the GNOME display properties
      dialog to query information about it.
    - Fixed a bug that caused audio over HDMI to not work on some GPUs
      after querying the RandR configuration (e.g., `xrandr -q`).
    - Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfo" X configuration option to report
      the layout of multiple display devices within an X screen.  This is
      enabled by default.  When disabled on X servers with RandR 1.2
      support, the NVIDIA X driver will report one screen-sized region.
      When disabled on X servers without RandR 1.2 support, no Xinerama
      information will be reported.  For backwards compatibility, the
      "NoTwinViewXineramaInfo" option disables nvidiaXineramaInfo.
    - Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder" X configuration option as
      a replacement for "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder".  For backwards
      compatibility, "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder" is kept as a synonym for
      "nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder".
    - Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfoOverride" X configuration option as
      a replacement for "TwinViewXineramaInfoOverride".  For backwards
      compatibility, "TwinViewXineramaInfoOverride" is kept as a synonym
      for "nvidiaXineramaInfoOverride".
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the use of some SLI Mosaic topologies.
    - Added the "MetaModeOrientation" X configuration option as a
      replacement for "TwinViewOrientation".  "TwinViewOrientation"
      is kept as a synonym for "MetaModeOrientation", for backwards
      compatibility.

    - Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL programs to leak file descriptors
      when calling exec() on themselves.
    - Fixed rendering corruption at the start of new X server generation.
      (Closes: #651155)
    - Added X driver support for RandR 1.2 and RandR 1.3.  See "Support
      for the X Resize and Rotate Extension" in the README for details.
    - Extended the MetaMode X configuration option syntax with the
      following new attributes:
        "Rotation"    : specifies the display device's rotation
        "Reflection"  : specifies the display device's reflection
        "Transform"   : specifies a 3x3 transformation matrix to be
                        applied to the display device
        "ViewPortOut" : specifies the region of the mode in which to
                        display pixels
        "ViewPortIn"  : specifies the size of the region in the X screen
                        to display in the ViewPortOut
      For example, "DFP-0: nvidia-auto-select { Rotation=left }".
      See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices on One X Screen" in the
      README for details.
    - Removed the "TwinView" X configuration option; the functionality
      it provided is now enabled by default.
      Previously, the NVIDIA X driver only enabled one display device
      for an X screen unless "TwinView" was enabled.  Now, the NVIDIA
      X driver enables, by default, as many display devices as the
      GPU supports driving simultaneously.  To limit how many display
      devices are driven by an X screen, use the "UseDisplayDevice"
      X configuration option.
    - Added a "CurrentMetaMode" attribute to the nvidia-settings command
      line, to query and set the current MetaMode.
      As an example, these two commands are equivalent:
        xrandr --output DVI-I-2 --mode 1280x1024 --pos 0x0 \
               --output DVI-I-3 --mode 1920x1200 --pos 1280x0
        nvidia-settings --assign CurrentMetaMode=\
                "DVI-I-2: 1280x1024 +0+0, DVI-I-3: 1920x1200 +1280+0"
    - Removed overscan compensation configurability from NV-CONTROL and
      nvidia-settings. This can be configured, with finer granularity,
      through the ViewPortIn and ViewPortOut MetaMode attributes.
      See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices on One X Screen" in the
      README for details.
    - Altered mode validation such that for digital display devices
      the X driver only allows, by default, modes which are reported in
      the EDID.  Previously, the NVIDIA X driver allowed other modes,
      but implicitly scaled those other modes to one of the EDID modes.
      Now, only the modes in the EDID are validated and the X driver
      does not do any implicit scaling.  Any desired scaling can be
      configured explicitly through the new "ViewPortIn" and "ViewPortOut"
      MetaMode attributes.  See "Configuring Multiple Display Devices
      on One X Screen" in the README for details.
    - Removed Flat Panel Scaling configurability in nvidia-settings.
      Any desired scaling can be configured through the new "ViewPortIn"
      and "ViewPortOut" MetaMode attributes.
    - Hotplug events (specifically, the RRNotify_OutputChange RandR
      event) are now generated when display devices are connected and
      disconnected from the GPU.  Many desktop environments automatically
      resize the X desktop in response to these events.
    - Added display device name aliases, such that X configuration options
      that use display device names can refer to a display device by one of
      several names, including the RandR Output name for the display
      device.  The X log reports the list of aliases for each display device.
    - Updated EDID parsing to include more complete support for EDID 1.4
      and more recent versions of CEA-861.
    - Removed the "Rotate" X configuration option.  This was used to
      statically rotate the X screen.  Its functionality is replaced by
      the "Rotation" MetaMode attribute and RandR 1.2 rotation support.
      See the README for details.
    - Removed the "RandRRotation" X configuration option.  This enabled
      configurability of X screen rotation via RandR 1.1.  Its functionality
      is replaced by the "Rotation" MetaMode attribute and RandR 1.2
      rotation support.  See the README for details.
    - Removed support for the following NV-CONTROL attributes:
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING_DEFAULT_TARGET
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING_DEFAULT_METHOD
        NV_CTRL_DFP_SCALING_ACTIVE
        NV_CTRL_GPU_SCALING_ACTIVE
        NV_CTRL_FRONTEND_RESOLUTION
        NV_CTRL_BACKEND_RESOLUTION
        NV_CTRL_OVERSCAN_COMPENSATION
        NV_CTRL_FLATPANEL_BEST_FIT_RESOLUTION
    - Improved rendering performance for RENDER bitmap text.
    - Enabled the OpenGL "Sync to VBlank" option by default.
    - Expose the following additional FSAA modes via NV-CONTROL,
      nvidia-settings, and through X visuals and GLXFBConfigs:
        16X multisample FSAA on all GeForce GPUs
        Coverage sample FSAA on G80 and above GeForce GPUs
        32X multisample FSAA on G80 and above Quadro GPUs
        64X multisample FSAA on Fermi and above Quadro GPUs
    - Enabled conformant texture clamping by default in OpenGL.
    - Removed support for the GVO Clone mode NV-CONTROL attributes:
        NV_CTRL_GVO_DISPLAY_X_SCREEN
        NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_X
        NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_Y
    - Updated the NVIDIA X driver's handling of X configuration options
      that affect an entire GPU, not just a particular X screen running
      on a GPU (e.g., "NoPowerConnectorCheck"): for such X configuration
      options, the X driver will now honor the option on any of the X
      screens configured on the GPU.  Prior to this change, the NVIDIA
      X driver only honored such options on the first X screen configured
      on a GPU.
    - Added a checkbox to nvidia-settings to control the texture clamping
      attribute.  When the box is checked, OpenGL textures are clamped
      according to the OpenGL specification.  When it is unchecked, GL_CLAMP
      is remapped to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE for borderless 2D textures.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (290.03-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta 290.03 (2011-10-21).
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the driver from loading on some systems with
      integrated graphics.
    - Fixed issues in VDPAU that prevented allocating and displaying extremely
      large VdpOutputSurfaces.
    - Added support for limiting heap allocations in the OpenGL driver through
      the use of the __GL_HEAP_ALLOC_LIMIT environment variable.  See the README
      for further details.
    - Added an "Accel" option to the X driver to allow disabling its use of the
      graphics processing hardware.  This is useful when other components, such
      as CUDA, require exclusive use of the GPU's processing cores.
    - Modified how the OpenGL driver allocates executable memory so it may
      continue to function properly if /tmp is mounted noexec. As some fallback
      allocation methods may be prohibited under SELinux policy, the driver now
      supports detection of this policy as well as manual override of this
      detection via the __GL_SELINUX_BOOLEANS environment variable.
    - Fixed a bug that caused various GLSL built-in uniforms to not
      be updated properly when calling glPopAttrib.
    - Improved performance by caching compiled OpenGL shaders to disk. Added a
      "GLShaderDiskCache" option to the X driver to enable/disable this
      feature. Added the __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE and __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE_PATH
      environment variables for further configuration. See the README for
      further details.
  * New upstream long-lived branch release 275.36 (2011-11-04).
    - Added support for the following GPU: GeForce 510.

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * New upstream release 275.28 (2011-09-09).
    * WARNING: this is a downgrade, some features added in 280.xx are no
      longer available and some devices may be no longer supported.
    - Added support for xserver ABI 11 (xorg-server 1.11).
    - Fixed a bug that caused the GLSL built-in uniforms gl_FrontMaterial
      and gl_BackMaterial to not be updated properly when calling
      glMaterial from a display list.
    - Fixed an error handling bug that caused the OpenGL driver to
      crash while running certain WebGL applications.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU that caused a glibc assertion when a call to
      VdpDeviceCreateX11 failed in certain ways.
  * Add xorg-video-abi-11 as alternative dependency and bump xserver-xorg-core
    dependency.  (Closes: #639737)

  * Avoid multiarch file conflicts:
    - Install the x86 README.txt in libgl1-nvidia-glx and nvidia-vdpau-driver.
    - Use wildcards instead of multiarch paths in *.lintian-overrides.
  * Work around make bug #635317: "make 3.82 breaks kernel module build:
    'mixed implicit and normal rules' in linux-headers-*" (only affects the
    version in experimental) by adding Breaks: make (= 3.82-1) to the source
    packages.  (Closes: #640539)

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * Add experimental alternative dependency on xorg-video-abi-11 for using the
    NVIDIA driver with Xserver 1.11 in unstable.  NVIDIA does not yet support
    this version officially, therefore the "IgnoreABI" option needs to be

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * Upload to experimental.
  * Add XS-Autobuild: yes to debian/control.  See instructions in #602838.
  * Add Pre-Depends: glx-diversions to the transitional packages to ensure
    clean diversion upgrades in some corner cases.
  * Install the following files that exist in both current and legacy drivers
    into a version specific directory /usr/lib/nvidia/{current,legacy-*}:
    libGL.so.1, libglx.so, nvidia_drv.so, libnvidia-cfg.so.1,
    libXvMCNVIDIA.so.1, libXvMCNVIDIA_dynamic.so.1, nvidia-bug-report.sh.
  * The 'nvidia' alternative (set up by package nvidia-alternative{,-legacy-*})
    handles creation of appropriate symlinks in /usr/lib/nvidia.
  * The 'glx' alternative (set up by package glx-alternative-nvidia) handles
    creation of appropriate symlinks in /usr/lib, /usr/lib/xorg, etc.
  * Update bug-script to list files in the new private directory as well as in
    multiarch directories.
  * Enable multiarch build.
    - Add Multi-Arch: same/foreign/allowed.
    - Use compat level 9.
    - Work around missing multiarch support in libvdpau1.
  * Add Conflicts: lib{*}-ia32 [i386] to lib{*} to prevent mixing multiarch
    and biarch packages, e.g. lib{*}:i386 and lib{*}-ia32:amd64 on amd64.
  * Stop working around the upstream tarball layout changes after 195xx, work
    around this in the legacy packages instead.
  * Provide nvidia-glx-any, xserver-xorg-video-nvidia-any,
    libgl1-nvidia-glx-any, libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32-any.
  * Convert the Conflicts: *-legacy-*, fglrx-* to versioned Breaks: as the
    library and driver parts should be co-installable by now.  There still can
    be only one nvidia-*-dkms package installed at a time as they all generate
    the same kernel module: nvidia.ko.  (Closes: #610021)

      or later.  (Closes: #629513, #627608, #625877)
    - Modified the X driver to request that hardware inform the audio driver
      whenever a display is disabled. This will allow the audio driver to
      generate the appropriate jack unplug events to applications.
    - Added support for the GL_EXT_x11_sync_object extension.  See the
      extension specification in the OpenGL registry here:
        https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_x11_sync_object.txt

    - Added support for hardware button based pairing to NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro.
      Single click button on the hub to enter into a pairing mode which pairs
      one pair of glasses at a time. Double click the same button on the
      hub to enter into a pairing mode which pairs multiple pairs of glasses
      at a time.
    - Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions:
      GL_NV_framebuffer_multisample_coverage
      GL_NV_texture_barrier

    - Fixed a bug that caused corruption on the menus in OpenOffice.org when the
      screen is rotated.
    - Improved performance of certain memory allocations.
    - Fixed a bug that caused Java 2D widgets to disappear when Java is
      configured to render using FBOs.
    - Added a new X configuration option "BaseMosaic" which can be used to
      extend a single X screen transparently across all of the available

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * New upstream release 270.41.19 (2011-05-20).
    - Fixed a bug in the VDPAU presentation queue that could cause 1
      second hangs when transitioning from blit-based display to overlay-
      based display. This would most commonly happen when disabling a
      compositing manager.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when capturing SDI video.
    - Fixed a corner-case in which the OpenGL driver could leak resources
      in applications utilizing fork().
    - Addressed a Linux kernel interface compatibility problem that could
      lead to ioremap() errors and, potentially, functional and/or
      stability problems.
    - Fixed a bug that caused SLI initialization to fail on some Intel
      based systems.
    - Fixed a bug that caused SLI initialization to fail when using recent
      Linux kernels, such as 2.6.38.
  * Update nv-kernel.ids.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Partially merge 195.36.31-91 (UNRELEASED).
    - Drop nvidia-kernel-compat-2.6.38.patch and adjust conftest.h to mark
      aquire_console_sem as no longer available in 2.6.38 and newer kernels.
      This avoids different behaviour between the kernel modules built from
      upstream installer and the Debian packages.
    - Add avoid-ld.gold.patch to explicitly link with ld.bfd.  The kernel
      module built with ld.gold does not work properly.
      (Closes: #625761, #626279)
    - Drop dependency on nvidia-common in favor of nvidia-installer-cleanup.
    - Convert nvidia-vdpau-driver{,-ia32} related versioned Conflicts/Replaces
      to Breaks/Replaces.
    - Turn nvidia-glx-ia32 into a transitional package, the libraries have
      been shipped in libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32 for quite some time.
    - Add support for arch-specific overrides (lintian 2.5.0).
    - Let the triggers only create the alternatives to diverted libraries if
      the diverted file is a symbolic link and points to an actual file.  This
      avoids failures running the triggers on some systems with broken
      diverted files.  (Closes: #626399)
    - Perform the same validation and correction of the diverted symlinks in
      libgl1-nvidia-alternatives and libgl1-nvidia-alternatives-ia32.
    - Add Depends: nvidia-support to nvidia-glx.  The new support package
      ships the nvidia-bug-report.sh manpage.
    - Override the binary-without-manpage lintian warning now that we provide
      a manpage (in nvidia-support).
    - conftest.h: implement conftest.sh function ioremap_cache (270.41.19).

nvidia-graphics-drivers (270.30-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * New upstream beta 270.30 (2011-03-02).
    - Added support for xserver ABI 10 (xorg-server 1.10).
  * New upstream beta 270.29 (2011-02-24).
  * New upstream beta 270.26 (2011-02-15).  (Closes: #616353)
    - Added NV-CONTROL event notification for NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SYNC_READY
      status changes.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce GTX 560 Ti.
    - Added a new X configuration option "Interactive", which defaults to
      enabled, but can be disabled to allow long-running GPU compute programs
      to run concurrently with X.
    - Fixed a bug in the VDPAU presentation queue that could cause VDPAU
      "display preemption" when rendering to tiny or zero-sized windows or
      pixmaps.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU which prevented use of the overlay presentation
      queue following an application exiting without gracefully destroying its
      VDPAU presentation queue.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU that prevented the overlay from ever being used if
      a presentation queue was created while the target window was redirected
      using the Composite extension when the presentation queue was created.
  * New upstream beta 270.18 (2011-01-21).
    - Reorganized the NVIDIA driver's /proc file system layout to better
      reflect current needs: /proc/driver/nvidia/cards/0..N has been
      moved to /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/0..N/information
    - Added new shared library: libnvidia-ml.so.
      NVML provides programmatic access to static information and monitoring
      data for NVIDIA GPUs, as well as limited management capabilities. It is
      intended for use with Tesla compute products.
      See web-based documentation and associated nvml.h header for more info.
    - Added a new X configuration option "3DVisionDisplayType" to specify
      the display type when NVIDIA 3D Vision is enabled with a non
      3D Vision ready display.
    - Fixed several bugs relating to hardware-accelerated gradients, which were
      causing visual corruption in some of the default Ubuntu GNOME themes.
  * New upstream beta 265 series.
    - Modified colormap updates to no longer be synchronized to vblank.  This
      allows applications to send XStoreColor and XStoreColors requests faster
      than the screen's refresh rate.
      This behavior can be controlled by a new NV-CONTROL attribute,
      NV_CONTROL_SYNC_LUT_UPDATES.  By default, LUT updates are not
      synchronized.  This may cause flickering in some applications that use the
      colormap to perform animation, such as xpilot running on a depth 8 X
      screen.  If you experience flickering, try running
          nvidia-settings -a [gpu:0]/SynchronousPaletteUpdates=1
  * Upload to experimental.
  * Update nv-kernel.ids.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Refresh use-nv-kernel.o.ARCH.patch.
  * Add package libnvidia-ml1 for the NVIDIA management library (NVML), a new
    library added by upstream.
  * Alternatively depend on xorg-video-abi-10.
  * Let nvidia-vdpau-driver Conflicts/Replaces the obsolete transitional
    package nvidia-libvdpau-dev.
  * Merge 195.36.31-90 (UNRELEASED).

nvidia-graphics-drivers (260.19.44-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * New upstream release 260.19.44 (2011-03-07).
    (Closes: #607430, #610755, #612136)
    - Updated the NVIDIA X driver to not update mode timings for G-Sync
      compatibility when NVIDIA 3D Vision or NVIDIA 3D VisionPro is
      enabled along with a G-Sync device.
    - Added support for the following GPUs: Quadro 2000 D, Quadro 400.
  * New upstream release 260.19.36 (2011-01-21).
    - Updated the NVIDIA kernel module to ensure that all system memory
      allocated by it for use with GPUs or within user-space components of the
      NVIDIA driver stack is initialized to zero.  (Closes: #609338)
      A new NVIDIA kernel module option, InitializeSystemMemoryAllocations,
      allows administrators to revert to the previous behavior.
    - Fixed a bug that caused X servers version 1.9 and higher to crash when
      color index overlays were enabled.
    - Fixed a bug that caused pixel value 255 to be treated as transparent in
      color index overlays.
    * Fix deadlock in some applications that fork.  (Closes: #612998)
  * New upstream release 260.19.29 (2010-12-13).
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce GTX 460 SE,
      GeForce GTX 570, Quadro 5000M, NVS 300.
    - Fixed a bug that caused some OpenGL applications to become
      unresponsive for up to a minute on some GPUs when changing
      the resolution or refresh rate.
    - Added support for NVIDIA 3D Vision Pro.
      See the "Stereo" X configuration documentation in the README
      for further details.
    - Added a new X configuration option "3DVisionProConfigFile"
      to allow user provide a filename which NVIDIA X driver uses
      to store 3D Vision Pro configuration settings.
      See "Appendix B. X Config Options" in the README for
      more information.
  * Merge 195.36.31-7.
  * Remove NVIDIA_kernel-260.19.34-778465.diff, applied upstream.
  * Update nv-kernel.ids.
  * Detect license changes by comparing debian/copyright with the shipped
    LICENSE during build.
  * Pre-Depend on nvidia-common for interactive (using debconf)
    nvidia-installer cleanup.  There is a mutual exclusion between using the
    nvidia-installer and the driver packages.
    - Checks for /usr/bin/nvidia-installer and asks the user whether to run
      'nvidia-installer --uninstall'.  If that fails, offers to just delete
      the remaining files.  If the user chooses to do the cleanup himself,
      installation is blocked as long as nvidia-installer is still found on
      the system.  (Closes: #605337, #611705)
    - Adds a pre-install hook for the nvidia-installer, giving a warning to
      users running a NVIDIA-Linux-*.run file directly while Debian packages
      providing the driver are installed.  This hook fails intentionally, but
      unfortunately the default choice if the hook failed is to continue
      anyway.  Therefore the hook tries to kill the nvidia-installer process.
    - Provides a script that checks for conflicting libraries (libGL.so.*.*
      remaining from previous usage of the nvidia-installer) and offers to
      delete them.  The script is intended to be run from postinst.  If the
      user chooses not to delete them, postinst configure fails as long as the
      user has not cleaned up or lets the postinst delete the files.
  * nvidia-glx{,-ia32}.postinst: run the cleanup of conflicting libGL.so.*.*
    (Currently the conflicting libraries are moved to
    /var/lib/nvidia-backup.XXXXXX instead of deleting them.) (Closes: #606175)
  * Install a dummy file in /usr/lib/nvidia/diversions to ensure it is not
    removed by some old maintainer script.  Causes trouble if the destination
    directory of some diversion is missing and the diverted file is installed
    later on.  (Closes: #608625)
  * Add patch nvidia-kernel-compat-2.6.38.patch to fix build with 2.6.38-rc
    kernels.  (Closes: #613798)
  * Depend on xorg-video-abi-8 without minor version (Closes: #612956) and
    provide xorg-driver-video to match what Xorg 1.9 provides and expects.
  * Add script build-module-packages.sh to the documentation of the
    nvidia-kernel-source package, uses module-assistant to do a quick build of
    the modules for all installed linux-headers.
  * Prevent concurrent installation of mismatching upstream versions of
    libgl1-nvidia-glx and libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32.  (Closes: #614040)
  * Catch module-assistant failures after nvidia-kernel-source updates without
    running 'module-assistant clean nvidia'.  Only works if the old version
    already contained this change and a module was built.
  * Use dpkg-parsechangelog to extract the upstream version number from
    debian/changelog, simplifying debian/rules.defs even more.
  * Update lintian-overrides to work with lintian 2.5.0.
  * Add patch fix-typos.patch to fix a typo in the module (found by lintian).
  * Drop Conflicts: binutils-gold, the problem is no longer reproducible with
    binutils-gold 2.21.0.20110302-2 and driver 260.19.44 or 195.36.31, so
    either the driver or gold was fixed inbetween.  (See #581336)

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Readd the Lintian overrides for the old embedded library tags, since
    part of the ftp-master verification process seems to be using an older
    Lintian.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (260.19.21-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * New upstream release 260.19.21 (2010-11-11).  (Closes: #603754)
    - Fixed a race condition in OpenGL that could cause crashes with
      multithreaded applications.
    - Fixed a bug that may cause OpenGL applications which fork to crash.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU that caused it to attempt allocation of huge
      blocks of system memory. This regression was introduced in the
      260.* driver series.
  * New upstream release 260.19.12 (2010-10-13).
    - Added support for the following GPUs: GeForce GTS 450, GeForce GTX 460M,
      GeForce GT 415M, GeForce GT 425M, GeForce GT 420M, GeForce GT 435M,
      Quadro 2000, Quadro 600.
    - Fixed the CustomEDID X configuration option so that it can handle
      EDID files from Linux procfs; e.g., /proc/acpi/video/IGPU/LCD0/EDID.
  * New upstream release 260.19.06 (2010-09-15).
    - Fixed an interaction problem with a change in X server behavior that
      caused slow text rendering on X.Org xserver 1.9.
    - Enhanced VDPAU to support interoperability with CUDA and OpenGL when
      Xinerama is active.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU that prevented temporal-spatial de-interlacing from
      operating when temporal de-interlacing was not also enabled.
    - Added support for configuring the dithering depth used when driving
      a flat panel with a GeForce 8 family or Quadro 4600/5600 or
      newer GPU.  See the "Dithering Controls" in the Flat Panel page
      in nvidia-settings.
  * New upstream release 260.19.04 (2010-09-08).
    - Added support for the nvcuvid API.
      nvcuvid provides a mechanism for decoding video and exposing the
      surfaces to CUDA, allowing applications to perform custom processing of
      the video. nvcuvid is primarily targeted at transcoding and video-
      processing applications. nvcuvid was already available on other
      platforms.
    - Fixed a bug in VDPAU that could cause a "display preemption" when
      toggling MPlayer to full-screen the first time.
    - Added OpenGL 4.1 support for Quadro Fermi, GeForce GTX 4xx, and
      later GPUs.
    - Enhanced VDPAU to fully support Xinerama.
    - Fixed a bug in the X driver that prevented operation of Xinerama when
      using multiple NVIDIA GPUs from different major hardware generations
      on X with ABI 4 or greater.
    - Fixed a bug in the OpenGL driver's Xinerama support.
      Rendering should have occurred to all physical X screens driven by an
      NVIDIA GPU compatible with the NVIDIA GPU driving physical X screen 0.
      However, if some physical X screen did not satisfy that requirement,
      then not only would that physical X screen not be rendered to (as
      expected), but also all physical X screens with a higher number would
      not be rendered to (which was unexpected).
    - Added GPU "Processor Clock" reporting to the nvidia-settings PowerMizer
      page.
    - Implemented support for SLI Mosaic Mode on Quadro FX 5800 and
      Quadro Fermi and newer Quadro GPUs.
    - Enhanced the VDPAU overlay-based presentation queue to allow it to be
      used when SLI is active, and in some cases when the X composite
      extension is enabled. See the README for further details.
    - Added support for configuring the dithering mode used when driving
      a flat panel with a GeForce 8 family or Quadro 4600/5600 or
      newer GPU.  See the "Dithering Controls" in the Flat Panel page
      in nvidia-settings.
    - Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect
      rendering) for the following OpenGL extensions: GL_EXT_texture_integer,
      GL_ARB_stencil_two_side, GL_EXT_transform_feedback2,
      GL_NV_transform_feedback2, GL_NV_conditional_render.
    - Added GLX protocol support (i.e., for GLX indirect rendering)
      for the following OpenGL extensions: GL_NV_point_sprite,
      GL_EXT_stencil_two_side, GL_EXT_point_parameters,
      GL_ARB_transpose_matrix, GL_EXT_framebuffer_blit,
      GL_EXT_framebuffer_multisample.
    - GLX protocol for the following OpenGL extension is promoted
      from unofficial GLX protocol to ARB approved GLX protocol:
      GL_EXT_geometry_shader4, GL_ARB_shader_objects, GL_ARB_vertex_shader,
      GL_ARB_fragment_shader.
    - Added support for configuring individual displays as any eye in passive
      stereo mode "4" when using TwinView or SLI Mosaic through extensions to
      the MetaMode syntax.
    - Added ColorSpace and ColorRange features for HDMI. These give
      the ability to output YUV over HDMI and select full/reduced
      color range on RGB over HDMI. ColorSpace and ColorRange
      are X Configuration options and can be changed dynamically
      through nvidia-settings.
  * Upload to experimental.
  * Merge 195.36.31-6.
  * Update nv-kernel.ids.
  * Drop 2.6.36-ioctl.patch, fixed upstream.
  * conftest.h: implement new (after 195.xx) conftest.sh functions
    pci_dma_mapping_error, scatterlist, pci_domain_nr, file_operations,
    sg_init_table.  Kernel versions of symbol (dis-)appearance from lxr.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Update lintian overrides.
  * libnvcuvid1: new package for the nvcuvid library added upstream.
  * Xorg 1.9 is supported since 256.53: add xorg-video-abi-8.0 as alternative
    dependency and stop providing xserver-xorg-video-6.  (Closes: #603755)

nvidia-graphics-drivers (256.53-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * Upload to experimental.
  * Merge 195.36.31-4, 195.36.31-5.
  * Stop shipping CUDA and OpenCL headers.  NVIDIA will stop including them in
    the 260.xx release.  The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (which is the only user of
    these header files) already contains them and is the recommended source
    for these header files.
  * Drop libcuda1-dev and nvidia-libopencl1-dev packages, move libOpenCL.so
    link to nvidia-libopencl1.  libcuda1 and nvidia-libopencl1 Conflicts and
    Replaces their old -dev packages for clean upgrades without transitionals.
  * NOTE to packagers of software that uses NVIDIA CUDA and/or OpenCL: use
    Build-Depends: nvidia-cuda-dev and/or nvidia-opencl-dev or
    nvidia-cuda-toolkit.  If a certain OpenCL API is required, add versioned
    B-D on opencl-headers, e.g (<< 1.1) for API 1.0 or (>> 1.1) for API 1.1.
  * Drop transitional packages that were released with squeeze:
    - nvidia-glx-dev (now Conflicts/Replaces by libgl1-nvidia-glx)
    - nvidia-libvdpau1{,-ia32}, nvidia-libvdpau-dev
    - libnvidia-compiler1{,-ia32}
      (now Conflicts/Replaces by libnvidia-compiler{,-ia32}).
  * Lower Priority of *-ia32 packages to extra (debcheck).
  * Switch default Section to non-free/libs with a few exceptions: x11
    (nvidia-glx), utils (nvidia-smi), kernel (nvidia-kernel-{source,dkms}),
    oldlibs (nvidia-glx-ia32).

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Use /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build as the default kernel build location
    for nvidia-kernel-source instead of /usr/src/linux, since this is set
    up automatically by the current linux-headers-* packages.
  * In the nvidia-kernel-source documentation, remove mention of setting
    KVERS, which should no longer be needed, and mention that setting KSRC
    is optional if the build link exists and you're building for the
    currently running kernel.

  * Upload to experimental.
  * Packaging based on 195.36.31-3.
  * Add libxvmc1 to Build-Depends.
  * Several libraries were renamed and SONAMEs were changed by upstream.
  * Ship new header cudaVDPAU.h.
  * Update symbols control files.
  * Update nv-kernel.ids.

    /emul/ia32-linux/usr/lib (reinstall libc6-i386 to fix)
  * debian/*.postinst(configure): abort early if DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE is

nvidia-graphics-drivers (195.36.31-92) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * Merge diversions, alternatives and multiarch changes from 275xx releases:
  * Switch to multiarch-aware diversion and alternatives handling provided by
    the glx-diversions/glx-alternative-nvidia packages.
  * Move handling of alternatives from nvidia-glx and libgl1-nvidia-glx to
    nvidia-alternative (new package) and glx-alternative-nvidia (from
    glx-alternatives).  libGL.so.1 and libglx.so (the Xorg module) no longer
    can be configured independently, avoiding possible mixed NVIDIA/MESA
    setups.
  * Convert old packages libgl{1,x}-nvidia-alternatives to transitional ones.
  * Note: The diversion and alternative handling of
    libgl1-nvidia-{glx,alternatives}-ia32 is not being changed.
    These packages will become obsolete by adding multiarch support.
  * Split the Xorg driver and modules from nvidia-glx into new package
    xserver-xorg-driver-nvidia (package name agreed by Cyril Brulebois).
  * Install the following files that exist in both current and legacy drivers
    into a version specific directory /usr/lib/nvidia/{current,legacy-*}:
    libGL.so.1, libglx.so, nvidia_drv.so, libnvidia-cfg.so.1,
    libXvMCNVIDIA.so.1, libXvMCNVIDIA_dynamic.so.1, nvidia-bug-report.sh.
  * Do the same with libnvidia-tls.so.1, tls/libnvidia-tls.so.1 and
    libGLcore.so.1 which are only supplied by the legacy packages.
  * The 'nvidia' alternative (set up by package nvidia-alternative{,-legacy-*})
    handles creation of appropriate symlinks in /usr/lib/nvidia.
  * The 'glx' alternative (set up by package glx-alternative-nvidia) handles
    creation of appropriate symlinks in /usr/lib, /usr/lib/xorg, etc.
  * Convert the Conflicts: *-legacy-*, fglrx-* to versioned Breaks: as the
    library and driver parts should be co-installable by now.  There still can
    be only one nvidia-*-dkms package installed at a time as they all generate
    the same kernel module: nvidia.ko.
  * Provide nvidia-glx-any, xserver-xorg-video-nvidia-any,
    libgl1-nvidia-glx-any, libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32-any.
  * Update README.alternatives.
  * Update bug-script to list files in the new private directory as well as in
    multiarch directories.  Collect xorg.conf and most recent Xorg.*.log.
  * Update bug-control to report information about some of the recently
    added/renamed packages.
  * Run check-for-conflicting-opengl-libraries from libgl1-nvidia*-glx{,-ia32}
    and xserver-xorg-video-nvidia* postinst.
  * Enable multiarch.
    - Add ${misc:Pre-Depends} to all library packages.
    - Add Multi-Arch: same/foreign/allowed.
    - Use compat level 9.
    - Use #LIBDIR# substitution variable.
    - Work around missing multiarch support in libvdpau1.
  * Run check-for-mismatching-nvidia-module from libgl1-nvidia*-glx{,-ia32},
    xserver-xorg-video-nvidia* and libcuda1{,-ia32} postinst, if available.
  * Add Depends: nvidia-support to libgl1-nvidia*-glx{,-ia32} and
    xserver-xorg-video-nvidia.
  * Remove the nvidia alternative before removing the libraries.
  * Only add slave links if the destination directory exists.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (195.36.31-91) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * Merge general changes from 270xx/275xx releases:
  * Update to Standards-Version: 3.9.2.
  * Drop nvidia-kernel-compat-2.6.38.patch and adjust conftest.h to mark
    aquire_console_sem as no longer available in 2.6.38 and newer kernels.
    This avoids different behaviour between the kernel modules built from
    upstream installer and the Debian packages.
  * Add no-smp_lock.patch to remove the superfluous inclusion of
    linux/smp_lock.h (kernel_locked is not used anywhere, so this seems to
    be bitrot).  That header is no longer available in 2.6.39-rc4, so this
    patch fixes build with the kernel in experimental.
  * Add avoid-ld.gold.patch to explicitly link with ld.bfd.  The kernel
    module built with ld.gold does not work properly.
  * Add linux3.patch to make the module build on linux-3.0.
  * Add nvidia-installer-cleanup as an alternative to nvidia-common.
  * Drop dependency on nvidia-common in favor of nvidia-installer-cleanup.
  * Add Pre-Depends: nvidia-installer-cleanup to nvidia-kernel-dkms.
  * Convert nvidia-vdpau-driver{,-ia32} related versioned Conflicts/Replaces
    to Breaks/Replaces.
  * Turn nvidia-glx-ia32 into a transitional package, the libraries have
    been shipped in libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32 for quite some time.
  * Let the triggers only create the alternatives to diverted libraries if
    the diverted file is a symbolic link and points to an actual file.  This
    avoids failures running the triggers on some systems with broken
    diverted files.
  * Perform the same validation and correction of the diverted symlinks in
    libgl1-nvidia-alternatives and libgl1-nvidia-alternatives-ia32.
  * Add Depends: nvidia-support to nvidia-glx.  The new support package
    ships the nvidia-bug-report.sh manpage.
  * conftest.h:
    - Implement conftest.sh function ioremap_cache (270.41.19).
    - Implement checks for generated/compile.h and generated/utsrelease.h
      (275.09).
  * Let nvidia-opencl-icd{,-ia32} depend on libnvidia-compiler{,-ia32},
    OpenCL code usually requires compilation at runtime.
  * Support backport specific operations in debian/rules by setting the
    BACKPORT variable in debian/rules.defs.
  * Set the supported Xorg ABIs in debian/rules.defs, use substvars for Xorg
    related Depends/Provides, compute the values in debian/rules.
    Add compatibility settings for old Xorg versions for backports only.
  * Drop lintian 2.4.3 compatibility overrides.
  * Convert lintian-overrides to use [arch lists] introduced in lintian 2.5.1.
  * Generate some *-ia32.lintian-overrides by swapping [i386] and [amd64].
  * Fall back to the old version of nvidia.ids if extract-pci-ids.sh failed.
  * Remove support for restoring the upstream layout used up to 195xx.
  * Canonicalize the location of upstream's README.txt, NVIDIA_Changelog and
    kernel module source path.
  * Add Conflicts: lib{*}-ia32 [i386] to lib{*} to prevent mixing multiarch
    and biarch packages, e.g. lib{*}:i386 and lib{*}-ia32:amd64 on amd64.
  * Add XS-Autobuild: yes to debian/control.  See instructions in #602838.
  * Add #MAJOR# substitution variable.
  * Add #LIBDIR# and #PRIVATE# substitution variables for generated control
    files.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (195.36.31-90) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * Merge general changes from 256xx/260xx releases:
  * Use dpkg-parsechangelog to extract the upstream version number from
    debian/changelog, simplifying debian/rules.defs even more.
  * Drop Conflicts: binutils-gold, driver or gold was fixed.
  * Detect license changes by comparing debian/copyright with the shipped
    LICENSE during build.
  * Catch module-assistant failures after nvidia-kernel-source updates without
    running 'module-assistant clean nvidia'.  Only works if the old version
    already contained this change and a module was built.
  * Add script build-module-packages.sh to the documentation of the
    nvidia-kernel-source package, uses module-assistant to do a quick build of
    the modules for all installed linux-headers.
  * Install a dummy file in /usr/lib/nvidia/diversions to ensure it is not
    removed by some old maintainer script.  Causes trouble if the destination
    directory of some diversion is missing and the diverted file is installed
    later on.
  * conftest.h: implement new (after 195.xx) conftest.sh functions
    pci_dma_mapping_error, scatterlist, pci_domain_nr, file_operations,
    sg_init_table.  Kernel versions of symbol (dis-)appearance from lxr.
  * Pre-Depend on nvidia-common for interactive (using debconf)
    nvidia-installer cleanup.  There is a mutual exclusion between using the
    nvidia-installer and the driver packages.
    - Checks for /usr/bin/nvidia-installer and asks the user whether to run
      'nvidia-installer --uninstall'.  If that fails, offers to just delete
      the remaining files.  If the user chooses to do the cleanup himself,
      installation is blocked as long as nvidia-installer is still found on
      the system.
    - Adds a pre-install hook for the nvidia-installer, giving a warning to
      users running a NVIDIA-Linux-*.run file directly while Debian packages
      providing the driver are installed.  This hook fails intentionally, but
      unfortunately the default choice if the hook failed is to continue
      anyway.  Therefore the hook tries to kill the nvidia-installer process.
    - Provides a script that checks for conflicting libraries (libGL.so.*.*
      remaining from previous usage of the nvidia-installer) and offers to
      delete them.  The script is intended to be run from postinst.  If the
      user chooses not to delete them, postinst configure fails as long as the
      user has not cleaned up or lets the postinst delete the files.
  * nvidia-glx{,-ia32}.postinst: run the cleanup of conflicting libGL.so.*.*
    (Currently the conflicting libraries are moved to
    /var/lib/nvidia-backup.XXXXXX instead of deleting them.)
  * Use /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build as the default kernel build location
    for nvidia-kernel-source instead of /usr/src/linux, since this is set
    up automatically by the current linux-headers-* packages.
  * In the nvidia-kernel-source documentation, remove mention of setting
    KVERS, which should no longer be needed, and mention that setting KSRC
    is optional if the build link exists and you're building for the
    currently running kernel.
  * Stop shipping CUDA and OpenCL headers.  NVIDIA will stop including them in
    the 260.xx release.  The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (which is the only user of
    these header files) already contains them and is the recommended source
    for these header files.
  * Drop libcuda1-dev and nvidia-libopencl1-dev packages, move libOpenCL.so
    link to nvidia-libopencl1.  libcuda1 and nvidia-libopencl1 Conflicts and
    Replaces their old -dev packages for clean upgrades without transitionals.
  * NOTE to packagers of software that uses NVIDIA CUDA and/or OpenCL: use
    Build-Depends: nvidia-cuda-dev and/or nvidia-opencl-dev or
    nvidia-cuda-toolkit.  If a certain OpenCL API is required, add versioned
    B-D on opencl-headers, e.g (<< 1.1) for API 1.0 or (>> 1.1) for API 1.1.
  * Lower Priority of *-ia32 packages to extra (debcheck).
  * Switch default Section to non-free/libs with a few exceptions: x11
    (nvidia-glx), utils (nvidia-smi), kernel (nvidia-kernel-{source,dkms}),
    oldlibs (nvidia-glx-ia32).
  * Drop transitional packages that were released with squeeze:
    - nvidia-glx-dev (now Conflicts/Replaces by libgl1-nvidia-glx)
    - nvidia-libvdpau1{,-ia32}, nvidia-libvdpau-dev
      (now Conflicts/Replaces by nvidia-vdpau-driver{,-ia32})
    - libnvidia-compiler1{,-ia32}
      (now Conflicts/Replaces by libnvidia-compiler{,-ia32}).
  * Prevent concurrent installation of mismatching upstream versions of
    libgl1-nvidia-glx and libgl1-nvidia-glx-ia32.
  * Provide xorg-driver-video.
  * Add patch nvidia-kernel-compat-2.6.38.patch to fix build with 2.6.38
    kernels.
  * Add patch fix-typos.patch to fix a typo in the module (found by lintian).
  * Update lintian-overrides to work with lintian 2.5.0.  Keep error overrides
    compatible with older lintian releases until ftp-master is updated.

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * If both original and diverted file exist when removing obsolete
    diversions, move the original file (which is not owned by any package) out
    of the way.  This problem may originate from incorrect diversion creation
    before lenny (and was not noticed or fixed in lenny) or having used the
    nvidia installer to install the driver in the past.  (Closes: #600327)
  * Add a NEWS entry recommending to update all pre-squeeze nvidia packages
    before switching to a -legacy- variant.  (Closes: #596843)
  * Update gdm/kdm insufficient timeout NEWS entry: mention xdm (no workaround
    needed) and that kdm was fixed in 4:4.4.5-4.
  * Document the warnings emitted by the maintainer scripts in README.Debian.
  * Install the upstream README.txt in the dkms package.  It is referenced by
    the package description.  Add a README.Debian, too.  (Closes: #602733)

nvidia-graphics-drivers (195.36.31-5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * Drop Breaks: xserver-xorg-core (<< 2:1.6).
    There is no file name conflict between /usr/lib/libGLcore.so.1 (from
    NVIDIA) and /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libGLcore.so (only in
    xserver-xorg-core << 2:1.6) that could cause the wrong library to be
    loaded by NVIDIA's libgl.so.
  * Change xserver dependency to 'xorg-video-abi-6.0 | xserver-xorg-core
    (<< 2:1.7.7)' as the driver is supposed to work with older abi versions,
    too.  This is not needed for squeeze, but helps backports to lenny.
  * Add Pre-Depends: libc6-i386 (>= 2.9-18) to all packages handling files in
    /usr/lib32.
  * Restrict nvidia-opencl-common Recommends: nvidia-opencl-icd-ia32 to amd64.
  * libgl1-nvidia-alternatives needs to Breaks: old nvidia-glx*-dev packages,
    some were shipping a libGL.so symlink which may cause problems on partial
    upgrades.
  * libgl*-nvidia-alternatives* needs to Depends: dpkg (>= 1.15) for using

  * Update versioned Breaks for the new NVIDIA legacy releases.
  * Add Conflicts: fglrx-driver, fglrx-glx, fglrx-glx-ia32 to the

  * libgl1-nvidia-alternatives-ia32: abort before configuring on broken

  * libgl1-nvidia-glx: don't remove alternative owned by libgl1-nvidia-dev.
  * NEWS: rephrase legacy 71xx note because these drivers no longer work with
    current Xorg.
  * nvidia-kernel-source: lower Recommends: nvidia-glx to Suggests to avoid
    pulling nvidia-kernel-dkms into the system before the user had a chance to

  * Add changelog entries missing due to concurrent development: 1.0.9625-2
    (experimental), 1.0.9625-1 (experimental) and 1.0.7174-4 (unstable).
  * Stop shipping libGL.so symlinks and handling alternatives involving them.
  * Stop shipping NVIDIA's copy of the OpenGL headers, depend on
    libgl1-mesa-dev instead.  NVIDIA will stop distributing the headers
    starting with the 260.xx release and recommends to use the official ones.
  * Transition from nvidia-glx-dev directly to libgl1-mesa-dev.
  * Drop the libgl1-nvidia-dev package (and stop shipping libXvMCNVIDIA.a).
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * New upstream release.
    - Drop patch NVIDIA_kernel-195.36.24-682377.diff, now included.
  * Update nvidia.ids.
  * Fix the dpkg-shlibdeps generation of packages built while nvidia-glx is
    installed: add back a special shlibs entry for libGL.so.1 and remove
    libGL.so.1 from the symbols file to ensure to generate a dependency on
    libgl1-mesa-glx | libgl1 only.  (Closes: #587091)
  * Install libGL.so* in /usr/lib{,32}/nvidia/ and use alternatives to handle
    /usr/lib{,32}/libGL.so.1 and /usr/lib{,32}/libGL.so.
  * Split the nvidia-glx{,-ia32} packages, move the runtime libraries to
    libgl1-nvidia-glx{,-ia32}.  (Closes: #369316)
    Since we use alternatives to replace the diverted files we can migrate
    the diversions in postinst instead of preinst to simplify updates.
  * Rename package nvidia-glx-dev to libgl1-nvidia-dev (add dummy package).
  * Introduce virtual packages nvidia-glx{,-ia32}, libgl1-nvidia-glx{,-ia32},
    libgl1-nvidia-dev, nvidia-kernel-dkms.  Add a matching Provides/Conflicts:
    to the corresponding real packages, so that the legacy packages can do the
    same and we can stop listing each variant we have in Conflicts and
    Recommends lists.
  * Add Conflicts: fglrx-driver, fglrx-glx, fglrx-glx-ia32.
  * nvidia-glx: install HTML variant of the README, too.
  * Update to Standards-Version: 3.9.1.  Not switching to Breaks+Replaces.
    Not touching old versioned Conflicts.  No other changes needed.
  * Rename the libnvidia-compiler1 packages to libnvidia-compiler.  The
    library is actually a (fairly huge) plugin used by libcuda1 (with the
    same upstream version) only.  It has currently no SONAME and starting with
    256.xx upstream will add a SONAME including the current upstream version.
    To avoid renaming the package for every new upstream release the SOVERSION
    will be dropped from the package name.  Add transitional packages.
  * Update lintian-overrides and minor cleanup of the packaging scripts.
  * Clean up more carefully after the module build.
  * Move diversions to /usr/lib{,32}/nvidia/diversions.
  * Remove possible LEGACY part from virtual package name
    nvidia-kernel-NVIDIAVERSION (provided by the kernel module).
  * Add a new substvar for marking the special driver from the NVIDIA Perfkit.
  * Add helper script debian/extract-pci-ids.sh to extract the PCI IDs of
    supported devices from nv-kernel.o.  Based on the nvidia_supported script
    found in Ubuntu's nvidia-current package.  Refresh nv-kernel.ids.
  * Add new package nvidia-smi for the NVIDIA System Management Interface (a
    TESLA control utility).  (Closes: #592482)

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Fix determination of the package name in nvidia-kernel-source when
    generating *.changes files.  (Closes: #589949)
  * The old nvidia-glx postrm would remove /usr/lib/nvidia/diversions out
    from under us, so ensure that it exists in the postinst of
    libgl1-nvidia-glx before creating diversions.

  * Add an nvidia-kernel-dkms package which builds the kernel module using
    DKMS and hence automatically does the right thing with kernel upgrades
    (provided the module builds).  (Closes: #334848, #395226, #528758)
  * Overhaul the build system in nvidia-kernel-source to not require
    module-assistant, be more robust in its derivation of the kernel
    version, and embed the kernel package version in the module package
    version.  Recommend nvidia-kernel-common since it's a dependency of
    the generated module package.  Remove the unnecessary recommendation
    of devscripts.  (Closes: #254859, #279182, #303521, #368669, #473378)
    (Closes: #523879, #534535)
  * nvidia-kernel-<version> now only recommends linux-image-<version>
    instead of depending on it, allowing the package to be used with
    hand-built kernels not installed as regular packages.
  * Build the tarball for nvidia-kernel-source directly in the staging
    directory rather than using dh_install to install it elsewhere and do
    that as a dh_auto_install override.  This simplifies creation of the
    nvidia-kernel-dkms package.
  * All packages that suggested nvidia-kernel-source now suggest
    nvidia-kernel-dkms as an alternative.

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * do not ship empty directory in module package
  * debian.binary/rules, debian.binary/install.template: use dh_install to
    install the module
  * debian.binary/rules: fix clean target if debian/control is missing and
    cleanup ancient code (closes: #241994, #295909, #460509)
  * update debian.binary/control.template using the copy from
    nvidia-graphics-modules-i386
  * include a copy of the NVIDIA changelog in the module packages built from
    nvidia-kernel-source
  * install the changelog from the nvidia-kernel-source package, too, if
    building via nvidia-graphics-modules
  * nvidia-kernel-source: bump debhelper dependency to 7 to match module
    packaging templates
  * merge debian.binary/copyright with debian/copyright.in
  * debian/control:
    - drop versioned Depends/Build-Depends satisfied in lenny
    - drop Conflicts/Replaces for packages existing before lenny only
  * TLS cleanup: Debian only ships TLS enabled 2.6 kernels, so remove all
    dynamic TLS checking and symlink updating code (closes: #394085)
    - nvidia-glx.README.Debian: don't talk about TLS any longer
    - debian/nvidia-glx.init: remove (inactive) tls symlink adjusting code
    - debian/nvidia-glx.default: remove, no longer needed
    - nvidia-glx.postinst: remove /etc/default/nvidia-glx on upgrades
    - stop shipping /usr/lib/nvidia/tls_test*
  * debian/nvidia-glx.bug-script: new bug script that reports a bit of useful
    version and hardware information
  * debian/control: bump debhelper B-D to (>= 7.2.3~) for dh_bugfiles
  * debian/rules: use dh_bugfiles to install bug script
  * Create symlinks NVIDIA-Linux{-i386,-amd64,} pointing to the extracted
    upstream archives to reduce #DIRNAME# and $(dirname_*) usage. (Using
    wildcards is not a good idea since beta releases use a different naming
    scheme.)
  * debian/*.in: replace #DIRNAME# with NVIDIA-Linux and rename *.in to * if
    this was the only substitution
  * patches/*, patches.save/*, patches.dpatch.save/*: remove, long obsolete
  * debian/rules: remove obsolete code
  * debian/upstream_info, debian/rules: simplify
    - add URL_X86 and URL_X86_64, include both URLs in debian/copyright
    - drop unused variables BASE_VERSION, FILENAME, DIRNAME, URL, RELEASE,
      UPSTREAMVERSION, NEXTVER
  * conftest.h: implement conftest.sh function acpi_walk_namespace (new in
    195.xx), acpi_walk_namespace is available since 2.4.0 (checked with lxr)
  * conftest.h: reorder and make INIT_WORK implementation more complete
  * debian.binary/control.template: rename to *.in
  * debian/rules: use same variable substitutions as for debian/*.in to create
    debian.binary/control.template

    reindent, simplify and unify; do not require root for building the tarball
  * debian/rules: rename target configure-stamp to unpack-stamp and fix
    dependencies
  * debian/rules: remove unused stamp files, targets and variables
  * maintainer scripts:
    - synchronize with dh_make templates
    - document the target release squeeze for some cleanup operations as a
      hint to remove them after squeeze release
    - remove code deactivated before etch release
    - remove diversion transition and cleanup code introduced before etch
      release
    - remove libwfb.so diversion cleanup code introduced before lenny release
  * nvidia-glx: stop diverting /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libGLcore.so,
    was removed in Xorg 1.6, add Breaks: xserver-xorg-core (<< 2:1.6) instead
  * nvidia-glx: stop diverting files not seen in etch or later:
    - /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libGLcore.a
    - /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.a
  * nvidia-glx: clean up diversion of /usr/lib/libGL.a (was not being created
    in etch or later), the file is provided by libgl1-mesa-swx11-dev which
    conflicts with nvidia-glx
  * remove empty maintainer script nvidia-glx-dev.preinst.in
  * debian/rules, debian/*.install.in: use dh_install instead of manual
    installation
  * debian/*.dirs: remove or minimize
  * debian/rules: reindent and simplify
  * debian/rules: switch to dh with a few overrides
  * debian.binary/patches/select-nv-kernel.o.ARCH.patch: add new patch instead
    of editing files with sed when creating the tarball
  * update lintian overrides
  * debian/rules: generate most parts of the AUTOGEN list automatically
  * debian/changelog, debian/*.README*: whitespace cleanup
  * move files: debian.binary/ ==> debian/module/debian/,
    Makefile, conftest.*, patches.h ==> debian/module/
  * debian/rules: adjust for debian/module/
  * switch to source format 3.0 (quilt)
  * debian/module/debian/: set source format 1.0, the module source "package"
    is shipped as .tar.bz2 and unpacked with tar, therefore no newer features
    can be used
  * conftest.h: ensure the macros from linux/version.h are available
  * debian/module/debian/patches/conditionally-include-linux_version.h.patch:
    new patch, ensure linux/version.h is included only once (that header does
    not have include guards)
  * debian/README*: remove reference to http://people.debian.org/~rdonald
  * remove Randall Donald from Uploaders per his request
  * debian/control:
    - remove dependency on x11-common, probably remained from the X11R6 time
    - reformat, synchronize, use more substvars
    - add Conflicts with nvidia-glx-legacy-* packages
    - reorder packages for better logical grouping
  * install the bug-script in all packages as well as in the binary modules
    packages built from nvidia-kernel-source
  * replace shell script debian/upstream_info with makefile fragment
    debian/rules.defs
  * debian/rules, debian/README.source: add new target get-orig-source and
    simplify instructions for tarball creation:
    uscan --report && dch -v <version> && debian/rules get-orig-source
  * fix-2.6.33-build.patch: remove, fixed by upstream in 195.36.24
  * libcuda1.symbols: update for symbol changes in 195.xx
  * nvidia-kernel-source.README.Debian: mention dkms and m-a before everything
    else, drop some very outdated information
  * debian/rules.defs, debian/rules: add variable/placeholder LEGACY
    and new subst vars nvidia:Legacy and nvidia:LegacyDesc

nvidia-graphics-drivers (190.53-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Set urgency to high for RC bug fixes.
  * Add Conflicts and Replaces for the fix in 190.53-3 to the
    nvidia-*vdpau*-ia32 packages.  (190.53-2 installed files in
    the opposite package as was intended.)  (Closes: #577059)
  * Remove postinst for generated module packages.  This script used to
    set up the NVIDIA device files in /dev, but this is now handled by
    nvidia-kernel-common.
  * Remove empty postrm from generated module packages.
  * Tell update-rc.d to only start the nvidia-glx script and not create
    stop links, matching the LSB script header.  (Closes: #577055)
  * Make nvidia-kernel-source depend on module-assistant.  At least for
    right now, it uses the make fragments provided by module-assistant to
    implement required rules for the module building interface.
  * Make all Lintian overrides for binary problems that the license
    doesn't allow us to fix (unstripped shared libraries, executable
    stack, non-PIC code, etc.) general rather than referring to specific
    files.  We won't be able to fix these in any files they turn up in.
    This allows us to use static Lintian override files and stop
    substituting version numbers into them in debian/rules, simplifying
    the build process.
  * Add some additional Lintian overrides for nvidia-glx for the weirdness
    we need to partly replace the free libGL libraries.

nvidia-graphics-drivers (190.53-3) unstable; urgency=high

  [ Andres Mejia ]
  * Fix weak library dependency of dev packages.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4.
  * Include Copyright line in copyright file. Copyright line was taken from
    cuda.h header file.
  * Place updated NVIDIA license in copyright file.
  * Fix file permissions in installed files.
  * Fix installation of libvdpau_nvidia.so.* for nvidia-vdpau-driver-ia32
    package.
  * Add myself to Uploaders field in answer to bug #568952.

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * Set urgency to high for RC bug fixes.  The version currently in
    testing is not usable with the X server in testing.
  * Do not run configure under $(ROOT_CMD) in kdist_config.  kdist_build
    already runs that target under $(ROOT_CMD), so this provokes errors
    from fakeroot about nesting invocations.  Nothing this target does
    requires fakeroot.  Thanks, Bastian Kleineidam.  (Closes:  #416594)
  * nvidia-glx-dev should depend on libx11-dev since GL/glx.h includes
    headers from it.  Thanks, Baruch Even.  (Closes: #433178)
  * Do not remove /usr/lib/libGL.so on purge of nvidia-glx.  At that
    point, we've removed our diversion, so this is someone else's file and
    we shouldn't be deleting it.
  * Remove our diversions on aborted installations of nvidia-glx, since we
    may have gotten far enough to create them.
  * Document the nvidia-glx postrm cases and rationale in more detail in
    comments in the postrm.  Thanks, Sven Joachim.  (Closes: #575272)
  * Stop stripping the binaries.  The NVIDIA license does not allow us to
    modify the binaries in any way.
  * Stop generating debian/control and risking that the rules to do so may
    fire during a normal package build.  The only variable being
    substituted into the generated debian/control was the NVIDIA version,
    and that only in binary package stanzas.  Instead, generate an
    ${nvidia:Version} substvar with that value and use that substvar in
    debian/control.
  * Force source format 1.0.  The interaction of the packaging and the
    upstream source is way too complicated to figure out how to move to
    3.0 (quilt) at this point.
  * Add a preliminary README.source explaining how to import new upstream
    versions and build the package for upload.
  * Add an explanation for the non-free placement of this package to
    debian/copyright as requested by Policy 12.5.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

  [ Andreas Beckmann ]
  * Add Enhances: lib[32]vdpau1 to nvidia-vdpau-driver[-ia32].
  * Add Breaks: libvdpau1 (<< 0.4) to nvidia-vdpau-driver (new directory
    layout does not work with old wrapper)
  * Add Depends: lib[32]vdpau1 | nvidia-libvdpau1[-ia32]
    to nvidia-vdpau-driver[-ia32].
  * vdpau symlink cleanup: for the "plugins" only the
    /usr/lib[32]/vdpau/libvdpau_XYZ.so.1 -> libvdpau_XYZ.so.VERSION
    links are needed, nothing in /usr/lib[32]/ and no libvdpau_XYZ.so

  * nvidia-glx: add lintian overrides for spelling errors
  * debian.binary/control.template: make module package depend on the
    corresponding linux-image (closes: #463403)

  * Add more bug numbers to old changelog entries.

  * debian.binary/rules used the -a flag to copy the control.template file
    to debian-binary/control. If the former was a symlink, this would result

    also be a symlink to the same file. Removed the -a, now it works just
    fine.
